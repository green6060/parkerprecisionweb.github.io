			<title>Director&#039;s independence and Deed of Indemnity </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/directors-independence-and-deed-of-indemnity-2/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Mr Alastair McGregor was elected to the board of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited at its annual meeting on 30 October 2017. The company is entering into its standard form of indemnity in favour of Mr McGregor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board has determined, pursuant to NZX Listing Rules 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, that Mr McGregor is not an independent director because he is a director of a Substantial Product Holder, O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas (by virtue of OGOG&#039;s conditional interest in acceptances under its partial takeover offer of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas). &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Study shows commercial potential for South Island discovery</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/study-shows-commercial-potential-for-south-island-discovery/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Commercial potential exists to create a gas market in the South Island if a discovery is made&lt;br&gt;in the Barque prospect offshore from Canterbury, a new study shows. Development&lt;br&gt;associated with piping gas to shore could be an economic game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Development of Barque could double New Zealand&#039;s current oil and gas production. Up to&lt;br&gt;$15 billion in GDP and $32 billion in royalties and taxes could be generated over the life of&lt;br&gt;the field. In total, up to 5,740 FTE jobs per year could be created during construction, and&lt;br&gt;around 2,000 enduring jobs in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is the operator of the Clipper joint venture, where the Barque&lt;br&gt;prospect is located. Chief executive Andrew Jefferies says world-class safety and&lt;br&gt;environmental performance would be a bottom-line in delivering the project’s economic and&lt;br&gt;environmental benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;We work closely with local communities through formal relationships and community&lt;br&gt;panels. [http://southern.communitypanel.org.nz ] One issue that has been raised repeatedly&lt;br&gt;is how the community benefits from a discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;While the scenarios explored in the study are conceptual, the study finds that piping gas to&lt;br&gt;shore and a commercial gas market in the South Island have realistic potential to produce&lt;br&gt;jobs, exports, and considerable government royalties and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The commercial outcomes from either piping gas to shore or processing offshore are&lt;br&gt;similar. While both are economically significant, much greater economic gains could be&lt;br&gt;realised by the wider community if it got behind a gas-to-shore option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Natural gas from New Zealand has environmental benefits as an ideal energy source for the&lt;br&gt;transition to renewables. For example, carbon emissions would drop if dairy plants&lt;br&gt;transitioned from coal to natural gas. The study shows that fertiliser and methanol plants&lt;br&gt;could be built here instead of overseas – if that occurred, we believe natural gas from New&lt;br&gt;Zealand would be better for the globe than alternative energy sources such as Canadian tar&lt;br&gt;sands, Venezuelan bitumen or coal-bed methane from Australia,” Andrew Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study was co-funded by the permit joint venture and New Zealand Trade &amp;amp; Enterprise. It&lt;br&gt;was undertaken by consultancy MartinJenkins, which drew on data from Beca, Methanex,&lt;br&gt;Coogee, Ravensdown, Fonterra, PrimePort Timaru and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The joint venture has until April 2018 to decide whether to drill a well. If a decision to drill is&lt;br&gt;made, the well would need to be drilled by 2020. The historic chances of a commercial&lt;br&gt;discovery sit at around 20 per cent. The joint venture is actively seeking international&lt;br&gt;partners with the capability to operate an exploration well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Barque prospect is in the Clipper exploration permit in the Canterbury basin, about 60&lt;br&gt;kilometres east of Oamaru in about 800 metres of water. The permit to explore is held by a&lt;br&gt;50-50 joint venture between New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas and Beach Energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>OGOG AGREES TO INCREASE OFFER PRICE FOR NZOG </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/ogog-agrees-to-increase-offer-price-for-nzog/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Independent Directors unanimously recommend increased offer from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;• OGOG will increase offer price for New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas to NZ$0.78 per share &lt;br&gt;• New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Independent Directors unanimously recommend that shareholders accept OGOG’s increased offer. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;O.G. Oil and Gas (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (‘‘OGOG’’) is pleased to announce that it has agreed to increase the price it will offer to shareholders of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited under its partial takeover offer for up to 67.55% of the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shares that it does not already hold or control.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; The increased offer price is NZ$0.78 per New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas share, up from NZ$0.77 per share.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;This offer price is within the independent advisor’s valuation range identified in the independent adviser’s report contained in the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Target Company Statement prepared in response to the offer by Zeta Energy Pte. Limited (“Zeta”) dated 5 September 2017.  The price represents a premium of 24.8% over the closing share price on 9th August 2017, being the last date prior to Zeta publicly releasing its notice of intention to make a takeover offer, and a premium of 28.5% over the VWAP for the onemonth period up to and including 9th August 2017. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;OGOG already owns shares representing approximately 4.29% of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas’ fully paid ordinary shares.  Under OGOG’s offer, OGOG’s holding may increase to a maximum of 70% of the fully paid ordinary shares.  While OGOG’s offer allows for it to hold up to 70% of the fully paid ordinary shares, the minimum acceptance threshold will be met once acceptances result in OGOG holding or controlling more than 50% of the voting rights in New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;OGOG’s offer document, including the revised terms, is expected to be released to NZX later this week and mailed to shareholders early next week.  New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas’ target company statement, setting out the reasons for the Independent Directors&#039; recommendation, will be released and posted at the same time. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The offer will be open for 30 days from the date of the offer document (unless extended in accordance with the Takeovers Code) and remains conditional upon, amongst other things, OGOG obtaining all consents required under the Overseas Investment Act 2005 and the Overseas Investment Regulations 2005. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alastair McGregor, Chief Executive of OGOG, said: “We believe the increased offer for New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is fair and one that we are confident that shareholders will find attractive. OGOG believes strongly in the potential of the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas assets and is excited to have the opportunity to invest in New Zealand, a country where OGOG affiliates have worked successfully in the past.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT SHAREHOLDERS ACCEPT OGOG’S INCREASED OFFER&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Independent Directors of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas unanimously recommend that shareholders accept OGOG’s revised offer of NZ$0.78 per New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas share. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“The Independent Directors have unanimously voted to support the OGOG offer,” New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Chairman Rodger Finlay said.  “We are pleased that OGOG’s vision for New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas aligns strongly with our own strategy. I am confident that with OGOG&#039;s backing we will see New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas invest in exciting new opportunities for growth.”   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“I encourage all shareholders to read the target company statement carefully, in making their own decision on the OGOG offer.  Personally, I think it is important that the OGOG offer succeeds, so I will accept the OGOG offer for all of the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shares that I own or control (comprising approximately 0.5% of the total New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shares).” &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For further information about OGOG, please contact:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alastair McGregor &lt;br&gt;Chief Executive, OGOG&lt;br&gt; +65 6631 0951 &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Senescall Akers (New Zealand / Australasia enquiries) &lt;br&gt;Barry Akers &lt;br&gt;+64 21 571 234 &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brunswick Group (international enquiries) &lt;br&gt;Charlie Potter / Charles Pretzlik  &lt;br&gt;+44 20 7 404 5959 &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For further information about New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, please contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>ADVISERS APPOINTED FOR PROPOSED O.G. OIL &amp; GAS OFFER </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/advisers-appointed-for-proposed-o-g-oil-and-gas-offer/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The same advisers who assisted the independent response committee of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas to respond to a partial takeover offer from Zeta Energy have been retained to assist with the response to a proposed new offer, from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northington Partners will again produce an independent adviser&#039;s report on the merits of the proposed offer. Northington Partners&#039; appointment has been approved by the Takeovers Panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron Partners will be commercial adviser to the independent response committee and Simpson Grierson is providing legal advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas independent response committee comprises directors Mr Rodger Finlay, Dr Rosalind Archer, Mr Rod Ritchie and Mr Mark Tume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent response committee recommends that shareholders should reject the partial offer from Zeta, and advises shareholders to wait for their recommendation on the proposed O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas offer before taking any action in relation to that offer. Independent directors&#039; assessment of the offer will be provided to shareholders, along with the independent adviser’s report, in a target company statement that must be issued within fourteen days of an offer from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas being despatched. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Receipt of takeover notice – take no further action</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/receipt-of-takeover-notice-take-no-further-action/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has today received notice under rule 41 of the Takeovers Code from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. of its intention to make a partial takeover offer to acquire 67.55% of each class of the shares in New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas it does not already hold or control, for NZ$0.77 per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If successful, the proposed offer would result in O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas holding or controlling up to 70 per cent, but in any case more than 50 per cent, of the voting rights in New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas Takeover Notice, and the documents that accompanied it, are attached.  The board of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has formed an independent response committee to oversee its response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent response committee is the same as the committee responding to the partial takeover offer from Zeta Energy Pte Limited. The committee members are Rodger Finlay, Rosalind Archer, Rod Ritchie and Mark Tume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent response committee is not in a position to comment further at this stage. The committee will meet as soon as possible to assess the O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas Takeover Notice in detail. The committee will also immediately proceed with the appointment of an independent adviser and fulfilment of its other obligations under the Code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent response committee recommends that New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shareholders TAKE NO ACTION in relation to the O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas Takeover Notice until shareholders receive further guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is required by the Code to prepare a target company statement. It will be released to the NZX and shareholders along with the independent adviser’s report within 14 days after O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas sends an offer document to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders who are considering selling their shares before then are recommended to seek their own professional advice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Target Company Statement Released  </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/target-company-statement-released/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Independent Directors confirm their recommendation to reject Zeta&#039;s partial offer &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Target Company Statement prepared by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas in response to the partial offer by Zeta Energy Pte Limited is attached.    The Statement has been prepared in accordance with the Takeovers Code, and will be sent to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shareholders shortly, and in any event on or before 22 September 2017. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The Statement includes an Independent Adviser&#039;s Report by Northington Partners and a rule 22 report by Simmons Corporate Finance.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;As set out in the Target Company Statement, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&#039; independent directors unanimously recommend that shareholders REJECT the Zeta offer. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has previously announced it has received a proposal from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited to make a partial offer at 77 cents per share. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas proposal is not yet a formal offer and there is no certainty that it will develop into a formal offer. However, on the basis of the material disclosed to date, and if it becomes a formal offer, it appears superior to the offer from Zeta. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Your independent directors strongly recommend that you take no action in relation to the Zeta offer until the situation becomes more clear. If you accept the Zeta offer now you will lose control of your shares and have no opportunity to accept a better offer from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas if it emerges.   You will not lose any opportunity to accept the Zeta offer by deferring your consideration of it.   The Zeta offer must remain open for acceptance until at least 4 October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;TAKE NO ACTION  ON THE ZETA OFFER. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has indications of a  superior oﬀer from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Friday 8 September 2017 Zeta Energy Pte Limited mailed its partial oﬀer document to you, oﬀering to acquire shares from you at 72 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also on Friday 8 September 2017, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas received a letter from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited stating that it plans to make a partial oﬀer at 77 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas proposal is not yet a formal oﬀer and there is no certainty that it will develop into a formal oﬀer. However, on the basis of the material disclosed to date, and if it becomes a formal oﬀer, it appears superior to the oﬀer from Zeta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your independent directors strongly recommend that you take no action in relation to the Zeta oﬀer until the situation becomes more clear. If you accept the Zeta oﬀer now you will lose control of your shares and have no opportunity to accept a better oﬀer from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas if it emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The independent directors will shortly complete and mail to you the target company statement containing their recommendation in relation to the Zeta oﬀer. They currently expect to recommend that you REJECT the Zeta oﬀer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;You will not lose any opportunity to accept the Zeta oﬀer by deferring your consideration of it. The Zeta oﬀer must remain open for acceptance until at least 4 October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Board recommends that NZO shareholders TAKE NO ACTION on an offer from Zeta until further guidance is received from the Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An indicative non-binding proposal to acquire control of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has been received from O.G. Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Annual Result </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/annual-result/</link>
			<description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;NPAT $52.6 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NPAT attributable to shareholders: $62.7 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dividend of 4cps, fully imputed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has recorded a net profit after tax of $52.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net profit after tax attributable to shareholders of the group was $62.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year the company recorded a loss of $51.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fully imputed dividend of 4 cents per share has been declared, to be paid on 3 November to shareholders on record at 24 October 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Rodger Finlay said the company has sufficient operating earnings and imputation credits to sustain normal returns to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payment of the dividend requires a waiver from Zeta Energy because Zeta has issued a takeover notice. Zeta has given this waiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main contributor to the net profit after tax was a gain on the sale of the company&#039;s 15 per cent interest in the Kupe gas and light oil field. Together with the disposal of the mature Tui interest, the company has successfully minimised its exposure to abandonment liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Jefferies says New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has had a good year in an adverse environment for oil and gas companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The company&#039;s net tangible assets have a book value of 84 cents per share, substantially above the current share price. During the year, the share price increased from 46 cents on 1 July 2016 to 62 cents on 30 June 2017. Shareholders received a 4 cents per share dividend and half the capital of the company was returned in May.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas group had a cash balance of $125.1 million at 30 June 2017, up from $96.8 million a year ago. The cash balance includes $35.0 million being held for the settlement of Mitsui E&amp;amp;P&#039;s 4 per cent interest in Kupe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $52.5 million NPAT does not include any contribution from the Kupe acquisition as it has not yet completed, although it has an effective economic date of 1 January 2017. Corporate overheads were down from $16.8 million last year to $14.6 million, including oneoff expenses related to the capital return, due diligence on transactions, and employee final payments. $5.4 million of those overhead costs were recorded by Cue. The New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas corporate head office has been moved to lower cost accommodation and its corporate staff numbers reduced to 16. Ongoing vigilance of corporate costs will be a feature of the coming year at both New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas and Cue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration and evaluation costs were down from $21.9 million to $12.3 million and include US$2.2 million relating to the settlement of Cue Energy’s Medco dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Rodger Finlay noted that while Zeta Energy has notified its intention to make a partial takeover offer, the actual offer has not been sent yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The company has formed an independent response committee and a response document, called a &#039;target company statement&#039;, will be sent to shareholders following receipt of the Zeta offer. The Board continues to emphasise to shareholders that they should take no action on Zeta&#039;s offer until they receive the target company statement,&quot; Mr Finlay said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has gone through a major strategic realignment after selling our major assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;With strong cash reserves we are focused on acquiring assets at value in markets we understand at a scale and risk profile suitable for our size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Transactions in the past year have realised substantial value and we now have a better balance of investment risk, providing us with ongoing returns from an asset we know well, cash to enter new opportunities, and transformational deep water prospects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We continue to seek cash from our Indonesia portfolio and limit our commitments there. Following a review, lower priority assets in Sumatra are being shed, while we are looking to recover cash from our best assets there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are also looking to achieve more value from our investment in Cue Energy. Cue recorded a net loss of AUD$19 million. 50.04% of the Cue loss is attributable to the shareholders of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, after New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas increased its interest in Cue from 48.11% during the year. With accumulated losses of AUD$104.8 million in the past two years the Board is determined to integrate Cue into the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas group, and avoid unnecessary and wasteful duplication of services.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Receipt of Takeover Notice</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/takeover/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Pursuant to rule 42 of the Takeovers Code Approval Order 2000 (the Code), New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited (NZX: NZO) gives notice that it has today received notice under rule 41 of the Code (Takeover Notice) from Zeta Energy Pte Limited (Zeta) of Zeta’s intention to make a partial takeover offer under the Code to acquire an additional 41.955% of each class of the shares in NZO not currently held or controlled by Zeta. If successful, the offer would result in Zeta holding or controlling no less than 50.01% of the voting rights in NZO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the Takeover Notice, and the documents that accompanied it, are attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of NZO is not in a position to comment further at this stage. The Board will meet as soon as possible to assess the Takeover Notice and draft offer in detail. The Board will also immediately proceed with the appointment of an independent adviser and fulfilment of its other obligations under the Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board STRONGLY RECOMMENDS that NZO shareholders TAKE NO ACTION in relation to the Takeover Notice until shareholders receive further guidance from the Board. Shareholders who are considering selling their shares before then are recommended to seek their own professional advice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Employee Share Option Securities</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/employee-share-option-securities/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The date when some partly-paid shares in the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas employee share ownership plan can be exercised has been brought forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date-change results from a determination that changes in New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shareholding amount to a change in effective control of the company as defined in the employee share ownership plan rules. The determination triggered a requirement to notify participants in the scheme of their rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under plan rules, eligible staff have been able to pay 1 cent per share for shares that have then been held in escrow by NZOG Services Limited for a minimum of two years. Partly-paid shares are issued at a 20 per cent premium to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has determined that the various companies that make up Zeta Associates now collectively hold or control more than 20 per cent of the voting rights in New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, and this determination has triggered rights under the plan for owners of partly-paid shares. The two-year restriction on exercising the option will not apply and participants may exercise their options at any point until the final date when the option expires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3,911,000 partly-paid shares will now be eligible for release from escrow even though two years has not elapsed. Of this total, 2,911,000 were issued in September 2015 and September 2016 at a price lower than yesterday&#039;s closing price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employee share ownership plan participants may, at their option:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Maintain the current status quo; Or&lt;br&gt;• Pay up the full issue price of their partly-paid shares immediately, in which case full legal title in those paid-up shares would be transferred to them; Or &lt;br&gt;• Require the trustee to sell their partly-paid shares and forward the net proceeds of sale (that is, holders get the difference between the sale price and the balance of the issue price outstanding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A breakdown of the affected shares is attached on the next page. Consultation with holders of the majority of entitlements in the plan indicates that holders intend to maintain the current status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN SECURITIES AFFECTED &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Of the 6,622,000 securities held by employee share ownership plan participants, 2,911,000 were issued at a price below yesterday&#039;s closing price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market price for the Company&#039;s shares as at close of trading on 19 July 2017 was $0.60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total employee share ownership plan shares on issue are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;leftAlone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImage600240-employeeshare.png&quot; alt=&quot;employeeshare&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 8,420,000 million shares are held by NZOG Services Limited, having been issued under the employee share ownership plan. However, this figure includes 1.798 million shares forfeited by their holders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kupe Sale and Purchase Agreement Signed</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/kupe-sale-and-purchase-agreement-signed/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A sale and purchase agreement has today been signed by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas and Mitsui E&amp;amp;P Australia for Mitsui&#039;s 4 per cent interest in the Kupe gas and light oil field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction was announced in May and was subject to the Kupe joint venture participants’ pre-emptive rights and other consents and approvals. An NZX waiver was required for a transaction with a related party because the parties had previously been joint venture participants together in Kupe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other Kupe joint venture participants have not exercised pre-emptive rights, and the NZX waiver has been granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction remains subject to other consents and approvals (including regulatory approvals).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective date of the transaction is 1 January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe is offshore from South Taranaki. It comprises an offshore remote-operated production platform, a pipeline and umbilical cable to shore, and an onshore production facility near Hawera. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas previously held 15 per cent of Kupe, which it sold to Genesis Energy on 1 January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More detail about the transaction is available &lt;a class=&quot;documentLink&quot; title=&quot;284 - Kupe Q+A release&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/dmsdocument/284&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-ext=&quot;pdf&quot; data-size=&quot;64 KB&quot;&gt;here: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe is operated by Lattice Energy Resources (Kupe) Limited, which together with its related companies has a 50 per cent interest. Genesis Energy, through its subsidiaries, holds a 46 per cent interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas buys Mitsui’s 4% of Kupe For $35m </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-zealand-oil-and-gas-buys-mitsuis-4-of-kupe-for-35m/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has agreed to purchase Mitsui E&amp;amp;P Australia&#039;s 4 per cent interest in the Kupe gas and light oil field for NZ$35 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective date of the transaction is 1 January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe is a gas and light oil field offshore from South Taranaki. It comprises an offshore remote-operated production platform, a pipeline and umbilical cable to shore, and an onshore production facility near Hawera. The asset has a history with New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, which promoted the Kupe exploration prospect, operated the discovery in the 1980s, and retained a 15 per cent share through development of the field and first production in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Jefferies says Mitsui&#039;s Kupe interest is a good portfolio fit for New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sale of our 15 per cent interest to Genesis Energy in 2016 achieved a premium reflecting the asset’s strategic importance to Genesis and certain unique attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The acquisition of Mitsui&#039;s 4 per cent interest provides ongoing income from an asset we see as high quality, in our heartland, and it is an appropriate investment in relation to our size and scale. It provides us with rights in the event of any further transactions in the joint venture, along with further prospectivity within the licence area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The combined transactions allow us to better diversify our portfolio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction requires joint venture and regulatory approvals. The joint venture agreement provides for rights of first refusal. A waiver will be sought from an NZX rule requiring approval by shareholders for a transaction with a related party. Mitsui is a related party because it has been in a joint venture with New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas within the past six months - the Kupe joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction adds 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas reserves at 1 January 2017 (see reserves statement in the accompanying backgrounder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe is operated by Origin Energy, which has a 50 per cent interest. Genesis Energy holds a 46 per cent interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>  Capital return final court orders received </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/capital-return-final-court-orders-received/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has received final High Court orders approving a return of capital by way of a scheme of arrangement under Part 15 of the Companies Act 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 20 March 2017 New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas announced that it had received initial orders from the High Court to seek shareholder approval to return $100 million of capital to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas held a special meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, 12 April 2017 to vote on the proposed capital return. The resolution was carried with approximately 99% support of those who voted on the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has also received a favourable binding ruling from Inland Revenue confirming that the proposed return of capital will not be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as being in lieu of a dividend. Further details on this ruling are available in the company&#039;s announcement on 13 April 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme will involve cancelling one out of every two ordinary shares for a payment of NZ$0.62724388 per cancelled share – effectively returning the equivalent of approximately 31.4 cents per share to every holder of ordinary shares. Payments will be made within five business days of Friday, 12 May 2017, which is the record date for determining the entitlements of ordinary shareholders to participate in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, shareholders will receive NZ$100 million. Part-paid shares issued as part of the company’s Employee Share Ownership Plan will not participate in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;leftAlone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Uploads/table.png&quot; alt=&quot;table&quot; width=&quot;589&quot; height=&quot;233&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Inland Revenue binding ruling on Scheme of Arrangement </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/inland-revenue-binding-ruling-on-scheme-of-arrangement/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A favourable ruling has been received from Inland Revenue on a scheme of arrangement that, if approved by the court, will return $100 million of capital to ordinary shareholders of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The binding ruling means that the return of capital under the scheme will not be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as being in lieu of a dividend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the scheme, half the ordinary shares in New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas will be cancelled and holders will receive approximately 62.7 cents per cancelled share. Shareholders approved the scheme at a special meeting on 12 April 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scheme is now only conditional on receipt of a final court order approving the scheme. The company will be submitting an application for this court order shortly, with a view to implementing the scheme and making payments to shareholders before the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice received by directors is that the ruling confirms that the sums paid to shareholders under the scheme should not be treated as a dividend. Any profit (or loss) realised on the cancellation of shares should be tax free if the shares are held on capital account. This advice is a non-exhaustive guide and shareholders are advised to obtain professional tax advice applicable to their own circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further details of the scheme of arrangement are available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nzog.com/capitalreturn.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.nzog.com/capitalreturn.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Shareholders Approve Scheme of Arrangement</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-blog-post-9/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A resolution approving a $100m return of capital was passed by a resounding majority at a special meeting of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shareholders held at 10am this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following resolution was voted on by shareholders at the special meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“THAT the Scheme of Arrangement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) relating to the return of capital to the holders of Ordinary Shares; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) relating to the holders of Part - Paid Shares, as set out in the Notice of Special Meeting, be approved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The required voting thresholds for approval of this resolution were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) 75 per cent or more of the votes cast by holders of Ordinary Shares entitled to vote and voting on the resolution;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) 75 per cent or more of the votes cast by holders of Part - Paid Shares entitled to vote and voting on the resolution ; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) a simple majority of the votes of those shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resolution was voted on by way of a poll and the results were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;leftAlone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImage600178-table1.png&quot; alt=&quot;table1&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;178&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, 62.79 % of the votes of those shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution were in favour of the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, each required voting threshold described above was met , and accordingly the resolution was carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further resolution moved by a shareholder, &quot;That NZOG retain the $168 million plus enough from reserves to drill two wells off shore Oamaru for gas and or oil,&quot; was defeated on a show of hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas expects to receive a final ruling from Inland Revenue on the tax status of the capital return within the next week. It will then seek final orders from the High Court approving the Scheme of Arrangement, with the aim of completing the return of capital before the end of May.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Capital Return Interim Orders Received </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-blog-post-8/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On 8 March New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas announced its intention to seek a court-approved scheme of arrangement to return $100 million of capital to shareholders.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has now received initial orders from the High Court to seek shareholder approval of the scheme.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The scheme will involve cancelling one out of every two ordinary shares for a payment of NZ$0.62724388 per cancelled share.  Part-paid shares that have been issued as part of the company&#039;s Employee Share Ownership Plan will not participate in the return of capital. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The implementation of the scheme is conditional on: &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;• approval by shareholders at a special meeting, &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;• a binding ruling from Inland Revenue that the return of capital under the scheme is not in lieu of a dividend, and &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;• final court approval. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A shareholders&#039; meeting is expected to be held in April to consider the scheme.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;If shareholders approve the scheme, and the binding ruling is provided by Inland Revenue,  final court orders will be sought to implement the scheme.  Subject to receipt of this court approval, the scheme should become effective in late May.  Any update to this timetable will be announced to NZX. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Scheme Of Arrangement – Financial Information</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;On 8 March New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas announced its intention to seek a court-approved scheme of arrangement to return $100 million of capital to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas will today file an application in the High Court for initial orders to begin the process implementing the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of its filing, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is presenting the High Court with some key financial information.  This information shows the impact of the Kupe and Tui sale transactions on New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&#039; 31 December 2016 financial position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also shows the impact of the $100 million return of capital on this adjusted position. The relevant financial information is included in the schedule to this announcement, and should be read subject to all the notes and qualifications stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As previously advised, the implementation of the scheme will be conditional on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;approval by shareholders at a special meeting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a binding ruling from Inland Revenue that the return of capital under the scheme is not in lieu of a dividend,and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;final court approval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shareholders&#039; meeting is expected in April to consider the scheme.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If shareholders approve the scheme, and the binding ruling is provided by Inland Revenue,  final court orders will be sought to implement the scheme.  Subject to receipt of this court approval, the scheme should become effective in late May.  Any update to this timetable will be announced to NZX. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Scheme of arrangement to return nz$100 million to shareholders </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/scheme-of-arrangement-to-return-nz100-million-to-shareholders/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Directors believe a court-approved scheme of arrangement under Part 15 of the Companies Act 1993 is the best way to achieve its intention to return capital following the sale of the company&#039;s interest in the Kupe gas field off Taranaki on 1 January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis Energy paid $168 million for the 15 per cent New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is now seeking initial orders from the High Court to implement the scheme. The scheme of arrangement will involve cancelling one out of every two ordinary shares for a payment of NZ$0.62724388 per cancelled share.  Part-paid shares that have been issued as part of the company&#039;s Employee Share Ownership Plan will not participate in the return of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implementation of the scheme will be conditional on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;approval by shareholders at a special meeting,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a binding ruling from Inland Revenue that the return of capital under the scheme is not in lieu of a dividend, and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;final court approval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shareholders&#039; meeting is expected in April to consider the scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If shareholders approve the scheme, and the binding ruling is provided by Inland Revenue,  final court orders will be sought to implement the scheme. Subject to receipt of this court approval, the scheme should become effective in late May.  Any update to this timetable will be announced to NZX.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas Half-year Results</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-zealand-oil-and-gas-half-year-result/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The last eight months have been a time of transformation for New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas as the Company successfully sold its two major producing assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half-year accounts released today do not include the profit on sale of the company’s interest in the Kupe gas field, which was sold for $168 million, nor the disposal of its interest in the Tui oil field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both transactions were completed with an effective date of 1 January 2017 and therefore the full-year financials will give a more appropriate picture of the 2016-17 financial position. In particular, net tangible assets will materially change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate costs are now considerably reduced. Overheads in the six months to 31 December were down by $2 million compared to the previous year, despite the inclusion of one-off costs for restructuring at Cue and $0.5 million in costs from the sale of Kupe. Exploration expenses in the six months were $4.0 million, down from $9.4 million in the previous year. Capital spending on oil and gas assets was $3.0 million, down from $7.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas recorded a cash surplus from operations of $13.2 million in the six months to 31 December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Rodger Finlay says cash flows received by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas were strong during the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the twelve months to 24 February 2017, as New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas realised value from its assets and focused on reducing its overheads, its share price increased by 49.43 per cent. This was one of the best share price performances last year among NZX companies with a market capitalisation in excess of $150 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In addition, shareholders received a fully imputed 4 cents per share dividend in October.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A net loss of $25.4 million in the six months to 31 December 2016 was principally due to: Cue&#039;s impairment of its Maari asset ($7.7m); a loss of $2 million on Cue&#039;s sale of its lossmaking Pine Mills field in the United States; lower receipts from the Tui field due to production decline; production outages at Kupe and Maari; and $9.5 million associated with de-recognition of deferred tax assets related to Tui and Kupe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Jefferies says New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is entering a new stage of its life following the sale of its two major assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We achieved incremental value for our legacy assets and now have a lower cost structure in the business including a reduced executive team and lower corporate rental overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Progress will be more obvious in our full year accounts, which will include the impact of returning $100 million of capital to shareholders in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Growth will be achieved by deploying our remaining cash to acquire quality assets at a scale, risk-profile and price that suit our size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In addition, in New Zealand we are participating in two potentially transformational deepwater prospects off the South Island, including the Barque prospect that we estimate could hold 11 trillion cubic feet of gas and 1.5 billion barrels of oil or gas condensate liquid (best estimate, unrisked, in place across three horizons). This prospect alone could transform the national economy if it is successfully drilled with partners to help share drilling costs,&quot; Andrew Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Barque resource potential upgraded</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/barque-resource-potential-upgraded/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has updated its analysis of the Barque prospect offshore from South Canterbury and North Otago, and believes there is more potential than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the joint venture, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is in discussion with potential partners with experience and scale to drill the prospect, and is presenting the farmin opportunity internationally. Copies of a presentation containing summary information are attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the prospect in the Clipper permit, PEP 52717, has been underway since a 3D seismic survey was completed at the end of 2013. It revealed up to three horizons in the structure. Best estimates of unrisked petroleum in place (100%) in the three horizons now total 11 trillion cubic feet of gas (tcf), and 1.5 billion barrels of liquid (oil or gas condensate) within the proven petroleum system. (5.5 tcf and 750 million barrels net to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary reservoir target is estimated to contain 5.5 tcf of gas (best estimate, unrisked, in place) and 785 million barrels of associated condensate (best estimate, unrisked, in place). (2.75 tcf and 392 million barrels net to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has undertaken scoping development work and identified several  development concepts. The preferred gas recycling development concept could yield a 460 million barrel gas condensate field, as well as 1.3 tcf of gas from one horizon alone (100%,  best estimate, unrisked, prospective (recoverable) resources).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all three horizons were developed simultaneously, a gas-to-shore LNG project is considered the most likely model. It could yield 8.2 tcf of raw gas, of which 4.8 tcf could be available for conversion to LNG, plus 8.5 million tonnes of LPG and almost 600 million barrels of condensate (100%, best estimate, unrisked, prospective (recoverable) resources).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barque horizon volume represents an upgrade from the June 2015 quarterly report (265 million barrels net to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, best estimate of unrisked prospective resource) due to further detailed work on the possibility of gas recycling and viability of subsequent gas-to-shore development options (market assessments and numerical modelling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barque prospect lies in about 800 metres of water, approximately 60 kilometres from shore east of Oamaru. The target formations lie between 2,500 and 3,000 metres below mean sea level. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is the operator and holds a 50 per cent interest in the permit. The other joint venture party is Beach Energy (50 per cent). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The above includes no reserves or contingent resources and relates only to prospective resources. The estimated quantities of petroleum that may potentially be recovered by the application of a future development project(s) relate to undiscovered accumulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These estimates have both an associated risk of discovery and a risk of development. Further exploration appraisal and evaluation is required to determine the existence of a significant quantity of potentially moveable hydrocarbons. All volumes presented are based on a best estimate, derived from a probabilistic methodology for resources in place and a deterministic methodology for recoverable volumes, which are net of royalties and have not been adjusted for risk. Oil and gas contingent and prospective resources reported in this statement are as at 31 December 2016 and follow the guidelines set out by Chapter 5 of the ASX listing rules (July 2014) and the PRMS Guidelines (2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prospective Resources are those quantities of petroleum which are estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations. For the conversion to equivalent units; standard industry factors have been used of 6Bcf:1mmboe and 1Bcf:1.05PJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invitations to participate in the joint venture will only be made to appropriately qualified entities&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Tui Offer Accepted</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/tui-offer-accepted/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Tui Offer Accepted. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has accepted Tamarind’s offer for its 27.5 per cent interest in the Tui area oil fields off Taranaki, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamarind, based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, will pay New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas USD$750,000 in exchange for all shares in its Tui holding company, Stewart Petroleum. Tamarind in December announced an agreement to purchase the 57.5 per cent interest of the operator, AWE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stewart Petroleum’s assets and liabilities include a 27.5 per cent interest in the Tui field, and inventory of USD$4.7 million of oil. Working capital of $6 million will be transferred to Tamarind. Tamarind will also assume all field retirement obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective date of the transaction is 1 January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Jefferies said, “The sale of the Tui interest allows New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas to realise the present value of remaining Tui reserves while reducing exposure associated with the uncertain end of field cessation costs and timing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date when production ends will depend on expected oil prices, lease costs and field production rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas analysed the Tamarind offer and finds it compelling based on Tamarind’s specialist end-of-field-life capability, including optimising late stage production and abandonment operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since the Pateke-4H well went into production in April 2015 Tui production has been in line with our expectations and our valuation of this transaction secures that production profile in today&#039;s dollars, while it also means we minimise financial risks associated with the abandonment of the facility. We are pleased that Tamarind shares our value perspective,” Mr Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Angell, MD of Tamarind, said,“This acquisition is a logical next step in our investment in New Zealand and in the Tui Area. By acquiring this additional stake, we will be able to move quickly and in a focused manner to bring our field life extension plan to fruition. While there is much discussion about field decommissioning, Tamarind is confident with the strength of the Tui operating team in New Plymouth, this area will have many years of remaining production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While there is much discussion in New Zealand and the region regarding late life field management, Tamarind is confident of our ability to bring innovation in terms of technologies and methodologies for field retirement. This will allow the numerous stakeholders in New Zealand to have a much greater confidence that such fields can be managed progressively and at much lower costs and risk to all concerned,” Mr Angell added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is entering a new stage in its life. Having sold our legacy producing assets we are looking for opportunities to deploy our cash by acquiring new producing assets with a preference for gas in markets we understand,&quot; Andrew Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas Moves to 50.01% of Cue</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-blog-post-6/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has secured a 50.01 per cent holding in its subsidiary, ASX-listed Cue Energy Resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our controlling interest in Cue provides diversified  exposure to Cue&#039;s production and exploration interests in Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia,” New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Chief Executive Andrew Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue has production from its interest in the Maari oil field off Taranaki, and from the Sampang PSC in East Java, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a portfolio of exploration including the substantial Ironbark prospect in the Carnarvon basin off West Australia, and in Indonesia. “Cue has cut costs significantly, and refined its strategy. All of its shareholders benefit from these changes, which provide a positive reason to increase our holding to over 50 per cent,” Andrew Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas acquired 13,514,462 Cue shares in the current financial year at an average cost of 8.32 cents, increasing its interest from 48.11 to 50.01 per cent. The total cost was  AU$1,124,338.44.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Executive Management Changes</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-blog-post-5/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Executive management changes are underway at New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, with an ongoing focus on cost reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Jefferies says New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is entering a new era following sale of its interest in the Kupe gas field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will return $100 million of cash to shareholders by May and then we hope to deploy our remaining cash by buying production and reserves, and creating value from our portfolio. We are looking for assets that are suitable for our scale, with a preference towards gas and diversification in markets we understand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two executives are leaving after accepting new positions outside the company. Chief Financial Officer Andre Gaylard will leave at the end of January and General Counsel Ralph Noldan in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am grateful to Andre and Ralph for their contribution as colleagues. I thank them for their considerable service and as a company we wish them well,” Andrew Jefferies said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine McKelvey is currently Financial Controller and will join the leadership team as Chief Financial Officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is the next stage of our company’s evolution following the sale of our Kupe asset. As I promised when we sold our Kupe interest, we will be focussing on costs - taking this opportunity to streamline our organisational structure - while using our technical capability dynamically to pursue the right assets at the right price.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kupe transaction completed </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/kupe-transaction-completed/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The sale of the 15 per cent New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas interest in the Kupe gas field off Taranaki, New Zealand, was completed on 1 January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas received $168 million from Genesis Energy in the transaction, which was resoundingly approved at a special meeting of shareholders on 16 December 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Rodger Finlay says work is underway to return $100 million of capital to shareholders by May this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shareholders&#039; strong endorsement at the special meeting emphasises that the transaction realises a healthy premium for the asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The value received for the asset was at the higher end of our valuation range, exceeds the high end of the independent valuation range and produced an immediate increase in the share price from around 50 cents per share to around 62 cents when it was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has achieved the present value of future cashflows through the sale without taking on the risk of exposure to a single large asset dominating its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fresh acquisition opportunities are being actively screened and the transaction allows the company to better diversify to create further value for our shareholders,&quot; Rodger Finlay said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kupe Special Meeting, Chairman’s address</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-blog-post-3/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;16 December 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe Special Meeting 2016, Chairman ’s address&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quorum is present and we can commence this special meeting of shareholders of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for taking the time and travel to attend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business before the meeting is to discuss the proposed sale of our major asset, the Kupe field, to Genesis Energy for $168 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two specific Resolutions for you to consider, an ordinary resolution and a special resolution, to satisfy the various regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution 1: Approval of Kupe Sale Transaction (ordinary resolution)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THAT, subject to Resolution 2 being passed, the Kupe Sale Transaction, as described in the Explanatory Notes contained in the Notice of Special Meeting, be approved for the purposes of rule 9.2.1 of the NZX Main Board/Debt Market Listing Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution 2: Approval of Kupe Sale Transaction (special resolution)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THAT, subject to Resolution 1 being passed, the Kupe Sale Transaction, as described in the Ex planatory Notes contained in the Notice of Special Meeting, be approved for the purposes of section 129 of the Companies Act 1993, rule 9.1.1(b) of the NZX Main Board/Debt Market Listing Rules and all other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will speak to these two resolutions, and then open the floor. Following discussion, a vote will be taken by poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be asked to complete your voting forms and lodge them with the Computershare scrutiners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, the sale of an asset that New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has nurt ured for thirty years is an occasion for mixed emotions and rigorous analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has long taken pride in attracting partners, seeing Kupe through development and bringing it into production in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, we have provided much of the impetus over the last two or three years that led to upgrades in field reserves of around 50 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said at our annual meeting in October, the reserves upgrade at Kupe which we helped to bring, means more gas, with a plateau lasting longer, and costing less to access..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transaction allows us to capture the full value of this upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while we believe it is a quality asset, our responsibility is to ensure that we create as much value for our shareholders as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very favourable price Genesis has offered allows our shareholders to crystallise the reserves upgrades at a healthy premium reflecting of its status .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Genesis approached us with an offer, we stressed the need for a premium that reflected the quality we see in it and its potential for dev elopment, and – most importantly – the asset’s status in our portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set a price that recognised Kupe as our major revenue earner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Genesis met our expectations, we were minded to acc e p t it on the basis that shareholders expect us to maximise value. I invite you to consider an alternative history, where we de clined a premium offer for cash, an offer greater than our entire capitalisation and decided to not put the option in front of our shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe dominates our asset portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of its qualities as an asset, its position in our portfolio means our company is highly dependent on a single umbilical to shore from the platform 30 kilometres out to sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our main revenue stream is therefore fully exposed to potential maintenance interruptions and outages, not to mention repair costs should there be a need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of that uncertainty, the divestment will turn the future cashflows from Kupe into cash today while eliminating the investment risk of having a single large asset do minating our portfolio. The Board believes the offer from Genesis is very fully priced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is at the higher end of our valuation range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It exceeds the high end of the independent valuation range calculated by Northington Partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why the Board is recommending that you vote in favour of the transaction. We will shortly have time to discuss your questions, but I would like to take a moment to rehearse some of the more common questions I have been asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first that comes to mind is: What do we intend to do with the proceeds of the sale?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have around $200 million of cash at hand, along with our ongoing interest in exciting New Zealand deepwater exploration, Cue Energy, Indonesia and Tui. While we are looking to create more value from those interests, there are two important new considerations as a result of the Kupe transaction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the Board intends to return $100 million of cash to shareholders. Several options for returning capital are being considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will initiate work on a capital return immediately. We have already sought tax adv ice and arrangements will be in place early in the new year, and I expect to have completed the work by May of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we will pursue value - enhancing opportunities in a way that improves diversification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some high quality assets are coming to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen high profile examples in New Zealand, where both Shell and Origin Energy have announced their entire New Zealand portfolios are to be realised .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are aware of further quality assets in markets we understand. The same team that delivered the Kupe reserves upgrades is screening opportunities that work for a company of our size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe our team can create similar performance enhancement elsewhere. We think we can see ways to add value to some assets, in partnership with others who have aligned interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will only pursue those where we see a clear path to increased shareholder returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we won&#039;t do is sit on piles of cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so the sale allows our company to diver sify our future income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common question is – how do we know what the future value of Kupe will be when the oil price could return to its former levels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use a forward price of oil based on the Bloomberg consensus curve. This is an industry standard way to forecast future prices, that more or less averages the predictions of analysts. Further , the bulk of revenue is fixed price gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil price in future may go up – but it might also go down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to put a value on the uncertainty – whether we keep the asset or sell it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northington Report provides an independent view. It looks at a range of possible future oil prices, including high and low cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to see that the price in this transaction is 16 per cent above the mid range of the Northington valuation, and – as I mentioned earlier - even exceeds the high case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to think about the uncertainty associated with our partners’ views about the timing of development, and the gas market in which Genesis is our main customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale allows us to achieve the present value of the future cashflows without this risk. Finally, I would like to highlight rights that exist for minority shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Notice of Meeting sets out minority buyout rights that are conferred by section 1 10 of the Companies Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Kupe Sale Transaction is approved, &#039;Resolution 2&#039; on our agenda is a special resolution relevant to this matter, as it approves a major transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a shareholder to exercise minority buy - out rights, the shareholder must have cast all of their votes against resolution 2. If resolution 2 is nevertheless passed, the Notice of Meeting sets out a process by which the company may be required to purchase that shareholder&#039;s shares at a fair and reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so in summary, the transaction is an opportunity for shareholders to get a return of capital while not diminishing our financial capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allows us to better diversify. Our acquisition activities will be re - energised with an enhanced financial capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market has to - date agreed. In trading since the announcement the share price has risen from around 50 cents per share to around 62 - 63 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the resolutions were not approved, there would be a risk that the share price could revert to the pre - announcement price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I urge you to support this proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to now invite questions and comments from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Offer for Tui area oil fields</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/offer-for-tui-area-oil-fields/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The operator of the Tui area oil fields off Taranaki, New Zealand has reached an agreement to divest its 57.5 per cent interest. The agreement is subject to joint venture approvals. The operator’s announcement, containing further details, is available here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20161213/pdf/43dny9v58zl8d0.pdf&quot;&gt;http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20161213/pdf/43dny9v58zl8d0.pdf &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has received an offer from the purchaser, Tamarind, for its 27.5 per cent interest in Tui. &quot;As mentioned in the AWE announcement, the joint venture parties have certain rights in the transfer of operatorship,&quot; New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas chief executive Andrew Jefferies says. &quot;We are currently reviewing the announced transaction and considering the offer we have received to determine whether our interests are best served by accepting the offer or continuing to participate in the asset through its decommissioning phase.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Independent appraisal report of Kupe transaction</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/independent-appraisal-report-of-kupe-transaction/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is today mailing to shareholders an independent appraisal report on its sale to Genesis Energy of its 15 per cent interest in the Kupe gas field. The report is being mailed along with a notice of a special shareholder meeting to be held on 16 December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The independent Northington Partners report values New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&#039;s Kupe interest at between $130 million and $160 million. The sale price, $168 million, is 16 per cent above the mid point of the Northington valuation range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Proposed Transaction provides NZO shareholders with a significant premium over the standalone value of the Company’s interests in Kupe,” the report states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas acting CEO Andrew Jefferies says the report demonstrates the proposed sale price is very fair to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As at 30 June 2016 New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas held its Kupe interests in its books at $133 million, with a net carrying value of approximately $83 million. If the transaction had occurred then, it would have resulted in a gain on sale estimated at around NZ$89 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As Kupe is our major asset we needed to achieve a significant premium price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The value Genesis is offering is more than our entire market capitalisation the day before the sale was announced, and the share price has since increased from around 50 cents to trade as high as 62 to 63 cents per share. If the sale did not proceed these share price gains would likely be reversed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board recommends shareholders vote to support the sale. Directors intend to vote any shares they control in favour of the transaction. &quot;If the sale is completed, the Board intends to return $100 million of capital to shareholders in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The remaining strong cash position will allow the company to diversify away from a significant exposure to a single asset. We believe Kupe is a quality asset but, as our other major asset, Tui, ends its production, our future cashflow would be highly dependent on Kupe&#039;s single umbilical line to shore. It makes business sense to seek more diversification in our portfolio.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shareholders are being asked to support the transaction by voting on line, by postal ballot, which is being mailed today, or in person or by proxy at the special meeting in Wellington on 16 December.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>  New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas interest in Kupe field </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-blog-post-2/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has reached agreement to sell its 15 per cent interest in the Kupe gas and oil fields and production station to Genesis Energy for NZ$168 million. The effective date of the transaction will be 1 January 2017 and includes New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas entitlement to overriding royalty interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement is subject to approval by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shareholders. A special meeting will be arranged on 16 December 2016. The Board recommends shareholders approve the transaction at that meeting and directors intend to vote shares they control in favour. The approval of the Minister of Energy and Resources will be sought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since we worked with our joint venture partners to upgrade our Kupe reserves over the last year or so, we have been clear that the investment provides considerable upside for our shareholders. The transaction with Genesis allows New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas to realise this upside now, while removing the risks of development and uncertainty around future market conditions,&quot; New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas acting-CEO Andrew Jefferies said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are delighted to be transacting with a proudly New Zealand-owned entity, as the asset is a significant part of New Zealand’s energy infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The offer from Genesis represents a premium that crystallises the value that we see ahead. We expect the transaction to result in a higher share price that will substantially narrow the discount to underlying asset value. Our acquisition activities will be re-energised with an enhanced financial capability that allows us to better diversify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Should the transaction be approved at the special meeting, we will return $100 million to shareholders in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The company remains committed to our ongoing exploration obligations and this transaction provides a springboard into new investment opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First discovered in 1986, Kupe entered production in 2009. It is operated by Origin Energy, which has a 50 per cent interest. Genesis Energy currently holds a 31 per cent interest and Mitsui E&amp;amp;P holds 4 per cent. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas sells its gas from the field to Genesis, and its LPG to Vector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas believes the offer from Genesis is fully priced. It is at the higher end of our valuation range and therefore the Board recommends that shareholders should approve the transaction. A notice of meeting will be posted soon,” Mr Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>2016 Annual Meeting Chairman’s address</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/chairmans-address/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;27 October 2016 Chairman’s Address,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual Meeting 2016 10.00AM Thursday, 27 October 2016&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Te Wharewaka Centre, Wellington&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good morning ladies and gentlemen. As a quorum is present I call the meeting to order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to welcome you to the 2016 New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas annual meeting. In addition to the shareholders in the room I am advised we have received proxies and postal votes for 123 million shares representing some 37% of the company’s capital. I would like to begin by introducing my fellow members of the Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly I would like to introduce you to our acting-CEO Andrew Jefferies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s the first time he has had the opportunity to speak to shareholders, and with his background as an engineer he will be able to go into some detail about our operational activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later the meeting will turn to shareholders’ questions and then we will deal with the election of directors foreshadowed in the notice of meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will hear from both of the director nominees, and you will have the opportunity to put questions to them. After the meeting, please join us for a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to focus my remarks on the Board&#039;s strategy, including our plans for growth, our tight focus on cost containment, and I know many of you are interested in our ongoing approach to capital management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased that earlier this week shareholders received a fully imputed dividend of four cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with a 35 per cent increase in share price since the market opened for the year in January, the dividend means that shareholders are 45 per cent better off over all for the year to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributions resumed following several reforms that have been put in place since the company chose not to declare a dividend when it was not in a tax-paying position, which in turn meant it was not producing imputation credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been able to minimise our cash burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have changed our method of accounting so that exploration spending is immediately expensed, unless it leads to a successful discovery of hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have also pulled back on exploration because, in the current environment, oil prices are considerably lower than they were two or three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, the company has been able to move through the downturn in oil prices with significantly positive cashflows, which we are now able to distribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, the shareholder-approved program of buying back shares accelerated with a liquidity event, when we were able to purchase around 17 million shares on-market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with other purchases we have now bought back and cancelled around 6 per cent of our capital base. I see a statement of considerable confidence in the company from that event, because we would have been prepared to buy many more shares at that price, which was a premium to the recent market price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That there were not more sellers demonstrates confidence the business is on the right track and positioned to deliver further growth and further gains for shareholders. Our share buyback will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I would like to turn attention to the areas where the board sees future performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we will continue to keep tight control of our costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen the effectiveness of this in the past year. For example, head office employee costs this year are down by 35 per cent. Other overhead costs have also been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have been able to achieve savings, we have been able to maintain a focus on health and safety, where our biggest exposure is through our non-operated joint ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both management and the Board want New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas to be known by our joint venture partners for our insistent focus on health and safety processes. We insist on reviewing near misses incidents and accidents, audit joint facilities and ask tough questions over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest insights from health and safety practitioners is that businesses which get their health and safety processes right also get other business processes right and tend to be well-run operationally. So our active involvement in non-operated joint ventures helps to deliver better performance from our assets, and helps to deliver cost savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are taking a hard look at our costs, the drill bit looks less of a priority as oil prices remain subdued. We have been exiting our lower priority exploration acreage around New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining prospects are deepwater, very large potential blocks that can only be accessed after lengthy investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clipper permit off Canterbury is one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Barque prospect in Clipper is a potential game changer for the Otago and Canterbury regions, for New Zealand, and for our company if we were able to drill it successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can update you today on the progress of Clipper: We have recently received approval from the regulator for a change of conditions, which allows us to continue further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential partners are actively screening the data and reviewing our scientists&#039; work on Clipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their interest is significant in economic conditions when frontier basins like Canterbury have to clear high hurdles to beat the other opportunities on offer around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, our partner Woodside continues its analysis of deepwater prospects in Taranaki and the Great South Basin, where we are seeking opportunities of world class scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at resources in New Zealand, however, one opportunity on our radar is the potential to gain more from the producing Kupe field. Andrew Jefferies will talk more to that shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe is our most valuable asset and a good model for the sort of asset we would like to acquire more of - In a jurisdiction we understand, providing resources into a market where we can achieve sound prices, and with long term upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies that have weaker balance sheets than ours are beginning to bring similar assets to market. We screen them rigorously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest twelve months your executive has reviewed around 20 opportunities, none of which have met our investment hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a balance sheet capable of supporting acquisitions and the board is prepared to move, but only where we see a clear pathway to value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year our major acquisition was Cue Energy. In the last week you have seen announcements that we have consolidated our Cue position to confirm we control close to 50 per cent of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue has announced its intention to cut costs and exit low priority exploration. It has already exited its New Zealand exploration acreage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the largest shareholder in Cue, we share with minority shareholders an interest in better performance and value. I have great confidence in the strategy and governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen, you will be aware of the social context of our industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year virtually every government in the world signed up to the Paris agreement on climate change and the New Zealand Government ratified it recently, committing New Zealand to playing a part in reducing global carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I want to take a moment to talk about our role in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil and gas we produce helps to power our way of life. More than half the world&#039;s primary energy today comes from oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil helps to keep a billion cars on the road, 20,000 commercial jet airliners in the air and 50,000 ships at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas heats 40 per cent of the world&#039;s homes, generates 22 per cent of the world&#039;s electricity and powers much of the world&#039;s industry and manufacturing. Just about everything we use, buy, eat, wear or do requires fuel generated from oil or gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while the world is transitioning to renewables, it will take decades for the costs of new energy sources to fall to levels that make them realistic replacements in the energy mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to meet energy needs during this transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas is a clean, accessible, affordable, reliable and flexible energy source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parts of the world that rely heavily on coal - that&#039;s most of the world - natural gas can help reduce carbon emissions by replacing coal for uses such as generating electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At home, as the government is incentivising a switch away from carbon through its emissions trading scheme, we have begun to prepare for increasing emissions liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have a role to play in the energy mix and we will have for a long time into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do need to tell our story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s essential to earn the trust and support of our community. That&#039;s why I am proud of the work we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our company has community panels to provide a sounding board so that we better understand outside perspectives on our activity - as well as to advise us on social investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we asked community panels to report back about how they think we are going. I would like to read you some of their comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have found New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas excellent to engage with and very supportive of the suggestions and ideas we have put forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have found New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas very open and transparent about its motives...New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has been very proactive in seeking the views of members of the South Taranaki Community about social and environmental issues that they may be influencing in the region. ... This showed total lack of arrogance on behalf of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas. If this approach is maintained there is little need for further improvement in this area.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a resounding endorsement of the responsible, positive role we are playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our engagement reduces risk and builds the foundation upon which we can earn returns from our investment - as well as making a wider contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, for the first time, we have published on our website a sustainability report, to be open and transparent about our activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will take the opportunity to read about our performance on all our sustainability measures, including our environmental impact and safety as well as our community relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They show a company that is responsible, ethical, working in a way you can be proud of and making contributions that will sustain support into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to sum up: The business has come through a difficult year for the industry performing soundly from an operational point of view, delivering an excellent health and safety record, and, financially, delivering positive cashflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributions are being made again in the form of imputed dividends and, with our tight control of costs and excellent assets, I expect this to continue while our remaining exploration involvement minimises costs and offers exposure to profound opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would now like to introduce Andrew Jefferies to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so I would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to Andrew Knight, who completed his service with the company at the end of the financial year after nearly a decade first as an independent director and then as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Jefferies has been in charge of our engineering and operations since joining the company in 2013, and has been an impressive executive with around 25 years in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s my pleasure to invite him to address you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Annual Meeting 2016,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting CEO’s address Mr Chairman, thank you for your introduction. Members of the Board Ladies and gentlemen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m delighted to be able to address you this morning,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Petroleum Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first went to university in Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine years ago I brought my family here, after sixteen years in Asia and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a land of opportunity, and it is now our home. Three years ago I came to work at New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, I feel a real sense of privilege to be leading it forward, and hope today to share with you my excitement about our company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Rodger has talked you through the Board&#039;s strategy, I will sum up how we did last year and go into detail about some of our operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointing oil prices over the past year affected the industry the world over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset values were written down across the industry, and we were not spared. This reduction in asset values resulted in a headline loss of $52 million, of which $43 million was from Cue Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we net out the loss to the other Cue shareholders, the loss attributable to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shareholders was $29.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However: our producing assets continue to generate a heathy cash flow and, combined with a firm control of our costs, we are in a position to turn the dividend tap back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking underneath the result, earnings from operating and investing activities were up from $7 million to over $21 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you consider that the average oil price fell by 43 per cent, from US$68 to US$39 per barrel, and average US oil and gas earnings fell 60% our underlying result is strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash in the group at balance date was around $97 million, which was up from $84 million a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take this cash balance, and add the market value of our holding in Cue, then our share price values our investment in Kupe and Tui at less than $100 million - far below a fair assessment of the true value of these assets given their future ability to generate cash returns and sustain a dividend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to be buying back our own shares when they look this cheap in comparison to a fair valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s take a journey through where we are producing returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture has done significant work to identify growth opportunities at Kupe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the past year was a substantial increase in total Kupe 2P reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through analysis of production, and well data we found more resources than we previously thought were present, in addition - we can improve our recovery and at the same time we have been able to push out the requirement to invest capital to develop these additional reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing onshore compression will help to optimise gas recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onshore compression is a relatively cheap initiative that, in simple terms, means we suck harder on the straw, and get more out of the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe additional perforations in existing wells will allow more petroleum to flow from the rock into the wells. This sort of activity has an excellent rate of return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other good news from Kupe is the identification of structures within drilling reach of the platform that will be the targets of at least one infill well in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short Kupe has more gas, with a plateau lasting longer, and costing less to access….more for longer for less…more for longer for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot to like there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Tui asset, in contrast, is coming to the end of its economic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&#039;t yet know when that will be because we will call time when the cost of getting the oil out exceeds the value we realise from selling the it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be an economic decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When oil prices fell into the $30 range we were operating the Tui field at a loss - it was costing us more to get the oil out than we could sell it for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was why we took an impairment on the remaining value in the Tui field, which contributed to last year&#039;s loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the oil price rose back to the high $40s again, we couldn&#039;t write the value of the asset back up because of the way the accounting rules work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we are again selling Tui oil at a profit and it makes sense to keep producing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we do decommission Tui, there will still be quantities of recoverable but uneconomic oil, as there is in all decommissioned oil fields. The Tui wells will be the first subsea production wells to be decommissioned in New Zealand, though it is done regularly worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on planning the end of field life has begun. The operator is intending to remove all the production equipment from at least 2 meters below the seabed on up - the well heads, production pipelines, mooring buoy and of course the floating production vessel Umuroa which will restart its engines and sail away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture will go through a consenting process with the Environmental Protection Agency. This will take time. So we need to make decisions looking further ahead, such as whether to renew the lease on the Umuroa. On our current assumptions we estimate that Tui production will end in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time as planning abandonment, management and the joint venture have worked hard to cut costs at Tui. Despite unfavourable exchange rates, Tui costs were reduced by more than 20%, a great help to extending field life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs were also minimised during the year in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the group is cashflow positive from Indonesia because of production from the Sampang facility, where more work is planned to extend the life of that field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now we hoped to be producing from the Kisaran discoveries, where we have government approval of a Plan of Development, but lower oil prices are a significant headwind in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few years available before a decision has to be made on commencing production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now we are looking hard at how we can maximise returns from our Indonesian portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Rodger mentioned earlier, we have concluded our discussions with the government about a change of conditions in the Clipper permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise the situation - we need more time to look at new information about the geology of the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our scientists have analysed the Endurance seismic survey we performed in 2014, and identified a prospect called Barque. To get an idea of its size, we estimate reservoir sands draped over a structure the shape of Banks Peninsula, and looking out the window here, an area equal to twice Wellington Harbour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have received some great new information from a well in a nearby permit. Its modern logging is helping fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the rock, resolving uncertainties so we can get to a decision about a well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile we have made promising progress in our other deepwater permits that we hold with Woodside in the Great South Basin and in North Taranaki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the petroleum conference in March Woodside revealed some of the technical work they have done at Toroa, which is south east of the South Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are seeing three separate layers of potential resource there, stacked on top of each other. Each layer is itself very large and the permit has seen 2 wells in the 1970’s that had clear indications of an oil and gas system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are maintaining exposure to these deepwater permits because they would be gamechangers. These are potentially huge fields, each one multiples of Maui and any of them big enough to establish a new industry in the South Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A discovery would deliver staggering returns, not just to our partners and shareholders; to the local area in terms well paid jobs, and economic growth; and to the country with money for hospitals, schools, universities, and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these are frontier basins, where wells are few and little is known about the geology, so we need to be careful to manage our spending in developing concepts while maintaining exposure to profitable new assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to tell you that even in this difficult price environment we are in continuing negotiations with potential partners about joining these deepwater ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Rodger indicated, we continue to look at potential assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for assets in the oil and gas space is similar to fishing….and as John West say “it’s the Salmon that John West reject that makes John West the best”. We have the same excellent team that delivered the value at Kupe, looking at potential assets, and we will be bringing forward the only the best that can improve our rate of return and provide you, with growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, we have a portfolio that provides hope for a substantial discovery, production that is capable of sustaining our dividend as long as we keep a tight grip on our costs, and the balance sheet strength to look for significant acquisitions at value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas you have a business that is using our technical, commercial, legal, financial, engagement and management skills to harness these rich opportunities and turn them into returns for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m proud that we are focussed on safe operations, and on being good partners for everyone who has a stake in our industry. I&#039;m proud of the business we are building, and I&#039;m proud that we are doing it by living our values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ll look forward to discussing more of these issues with you as the chairman opens up the floor for questions, and I hope to chat with as many of you as possible over a cup of tea after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Clipper change of conditions granted</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/clipper-change-of-conditions-granted/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;PEP 52717 Clipper change of conditions granted Work continues on New Zealand&#039;s largest publicly-announced petroleum prospect, with approval by the regulator for a change of conditions and extension of duration for Petroleum Exploration Permit 52717 Clipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New information is being analysed relating to the Canterbury Basin where New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&#039;s best estimate of prospective resource in the Barque prospect is equivalent to 530 million barrels of oil (265 million barrels net to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas). * This is equivalent to at least twice the amount of producible gas in Taranaki&#039;s Maui discovery, which has been in production since the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Barque prospect in Clipper is a potential game changer for the Canterbury region, for New Zealand and for our company,&quot; says New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas acting chief executive Andrew Jefferies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Government and New Zealand Petroleum &amp;amp; Minerals deserves considerable credit for accommodating a change of conditions to allow further study of this permit, in recognition of its considerable economic potential and the need for further high quality scientific analysis.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions approved by New Zealand Petroleum &amp;amp; Minerals now require a decision on whether to commit to drilling an exploration well by 10 April 2018, and if a positive drill decision were made it would have to be drilled by 10 June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 50% interest in Clipper, and is the operator. It&#039;s joint venture partner is Beach Energy. The JV is in talks with potential farm in partners that have the scale and capability to operate a large prospect in deepwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Cue Energy Resources, in which New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas holds a controlling interest, has announced that BP has acquired an 80% equity interest in one of Cue’s potentially game-changing very large prospects in the Carnarvon basin, offshore Western Australia. Details of Cue&#039;s announcement are here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cuenrg.com.au/irm/PDF/2195/CueEnergyFarmsOutNorthWestShelfGasProspectt%20oBP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.cuenrg.com.au/irm/PDF/2195/CueEnergyFarmsOutNorthWestShelfGasProspectt oBP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is very pleased to have exposure to these two exciting prospects, both of which have the potential to be transformational for our company. We are delighted to announce progress in both of them,&quot; Andrew Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is not aware of new information or data that materially affects this announcement. All material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimate continue to apply and have not materially changed. The estimated quantities of petroleum that may potentially be recovered by the application of the future development project(s) relate to undiscovered accumulations. These estimates have both an associated risk of discovery and a risk of development. Further exploration appraisal and evaluation is required to determine the existence of a significant quantity of potentially moveable hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Tender offer</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/tender-offer/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;NEW ZEALAND OIL &amp;amp; GAS ANNOUNCES TENDER OFFER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas intends to buy back up to 40 million shares through a tender offer on 16 September 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the offer are set out in a letter to shareholders, which shareholders are being urged to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum price the company intends to pay in the tender is 55 cents, which is a premium of 13.5% to the 30-day weighted average market price and more than 14% above the average price paid by the company for shares purchased this year. Approval to buy back up to 64 million shares was obtained by more than 73% of shareholders who voted at a special meeting on 28 August 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting chief executive Andrew Jefferies says the tender offer creates a liquidity event that should spur trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The company has been buying back its shares this year but, because the shares trade in small volumes, it would take years to complete the buy back at current rates of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Shareholders who wish to sell will have the opportunity at a price that represents a premium to recent share trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The buy back is part of the company&#039;s capital management that improves the efficiency of our balance sheet. All remaining shareholders benefit from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The company is reviewing acquisitions of assets coming to market. The asset we understand best is our own, and therefore it makes sense to buy our shares when we see&lt;br&gt;value,&quot; Andrew Jefferies says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas intends to continue its on-market buy back program following the tender.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>2016 Annual Result and Dividend</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/2016-annual-result-and-dividend/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;• Loss for the year is $51.8m, including $41.8m from Cue Energy Resources&lt;br&gt;• Net cash from operating and investing activities of $21.1 million (up from $6.7 million)&lt;br&gt;• Dividend of 4 cents per share, fully imputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;View and download &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Dividends/NZO-Consolidated-Financial-Statements-for-year-ended-30-June-2016.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016 Financial Statement&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Dividends/NZO-Final-Dividend-Appendix-7-20160824-Amended.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016 Final Dividend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas will reinstate distributions to shareholders with a fully imputed dividend of 4 cents per share to be paid in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company today announced a loss for the year of $51.8 million, compared to a loss of $15.5 million last year, which was foreshadowed in asset value write downs in the interim result. The loss attributable to the company’s shareholders was $29.8 million, reflecting the significant loss for the year in Cue Energy Resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A buy back of up to 64 million of its shares continues as the company believes its share price is currently substantially below a fair value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group had a cash balance at 30 June of $96.8 million, up from $83.7 million a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Andrew Knight says the group continues to generate strong free cashflows from its producing assets, after reducing corporate costs and exploration. Net cash generated from operations and investment was up from $6.7 million last year to $21.1 million this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The company is able to reinstate dividends because we have tightly controlled costs in a period when lower oil prices drove asset valuations lower,&quot; Mr Knight said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The highlight of the year has been a substantial increase in total Kupe 2P reserves as a result of significant work undertaken across the joint venture. The reserves upgrade, which was previously announced, has added significant value to Kupe by increasing potential volumes recoverable from Kupe and reducing the cost of recovering those volumes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group revenue from gas sales was down $1.3 million as a result of marginally lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volumes of oil sold from Tui and Kupe were down by 27 per cent and the average oil price was down 43 per cent from US$68.41 to US$39.32 per barrel in the previous financial year, resulting in a reduction in revenue from Tui and Kupe oil of $31.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However total group sales revenue was up by $2.8 million (2.4 per cent) to $119.0 million. A full year of Cue earnings is included in the result, contributing $49.5 million of sales, against last year when only one quarter of Cue’s earnings were included ($11.1 million).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating costs increased by $11.4 million in the year, as a full year of Cue&#039;s costs were included. Despite unfavourable exchange rates, Tui costs were reduced by $4.2 million, demonstrating the effectiveness of management’s cost saving initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus on costs successfully executed at New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has now been taken up by Cue who announced in June a shift in focus of activities and a commitment to reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has begun to manage its exposure to oil price, and to carbon emissions costs under the Government&#039;s emissions trading scheme, through modest hedging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oil trading markets and demand for carbon emissions credits provide opportunities to leverage the business&#039;s understanding of those markets and provide small opportunities to further improve revenues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Although exploration spending is considerably reduced, the company continues to engage with the government about a change of conditions in the Clipper permit east of New Zealand&#039;s South Island, where its Barque prospect is the largest announced hydrocarbon prospect in New Zealand. The company has received new geological data relevant to the region, and Barque in particular. This information is being analysed against our previous understanding of the region&#039;s properties, and we remain engaged with potential partners who have the scale and expertise to develop the prospect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has minimised its ongoing spending and is advancing plans to realise returns from its investment there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dividend of 4 cents per share will be paid on 25 October to holders on record at 11 October 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Resignation Of CEO</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/resignation-of-ceo/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas chief executive Andrew Knight has announced his resignation in order to pursue his business interests outside the Company. His last day of employment will be 26 August, following the announcement of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas annual results on 24 August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Knight has been chief executive since December 2011 and was previously a non executive director of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Over the last year New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has adapted to a changed economic context and I am pleased to have contributed to a significant transition in the company&#039;s focus and scale. The company is expected to be significantly cashflow positive in the coming year and has  a strong balance sheet. It is well positioned to pursue opportunities for growth through acquisition, from the permits in the South Island and by realising value from the existing production and exploration assets. Coinciding with this process of change the time feels  right for a new chief executive to take the company into its next phase,&quot; Mr Knight said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Rodger Finlay thanked Andrew Knight for his services . &quot;Under Andrew&#039;s stewardship, our company has adjusted its strategy to react to lower product prices, husbanded its financial resources and adjusted its cost base for the future, while maintaining strong community relationships and a uniquely New Zealand identity. We wish him great success in his future endeavours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board intends to appoint an acting chief executive and initiate a process for a long term replacement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Knight will also resign his position as a director of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas subsidiaries, including Cue Energy.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>15% increase in Kupe developed reserves </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/15-increase-in-kupe-developed-reserves/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has announced a further upgrade in developed reserves in the Kupe gas and light oil field off Taranaki, New Zealand, following analysis by the joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade from 5.22 million barrels of oil equivalent to 6.02 million barrels is further to a 34.7 per cent increase announced in October last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of detailed reservoir simulation uncertainty modelling, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has concluded a further increase in 2P developed reserves of 15.29 per cent. The upgrade includes an extra 3.6 petajoules of gas and 16.69 kilotonnes of LPG compared to 2P developed reserves at 31 December 2015 (less production volumes since then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Knight says the reserves upgrade is positive news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This reserves increase provides additional volume from within the existing development. It also provides further security that contracted volumes can be met without needing significant additional capital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the upgrade in developed reserves, technical work is nearing completion to assess options for developing undeveloped reserves of 3.2 million barrels (New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas share). These reserves were reported in the company’s Interim Report statement of total Kupe 2P reserves at 31 December 2015. The Kupe joint venture has not made a final investment decision on the undeveloped reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 15% interest in Kupe. The other Kupe partners are Origin Energy, 50% (Operator); Genesis Energy, 31%; and Mitsui, 4%.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Prospective resources in Indonesia </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/prospective-resources-in-indonesia/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas are presenting at international farm-out conferences and will disclose prospective resources in its directly-held Indonesia interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company’s prospective resources in Indonesia have not previously been disclosed. The resources are held across five production sharing contracts, three of which cover conventional reservoirs, while two are unconventional layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resources in this announcement do not include Indonesian prospective resources of Cue Energy, in which New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas holds a 48.11 per cent interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contingent resources are being introduced as the company markets its balanced portfolio in Indonesia. The company has a controlling interest in Cue Energy, whose Sampang asset in East Java is revenue-producing with further development potential to complement its producing reserves. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has contingent resources from near term development options at Kisaran, and prospective resources in conventional and unconventional plays, including drill-ready prospects at Mahato and Bohorok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With elevated energy demand and good fiscal terms, the outlook for Indonesia is positive. Indonesia is one of South East Asia’s most energy-hungry economies. Sumatra is particularly attractive because it has a large, well-connected infrastructure network and an energy-hungry population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its Interim Report New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas reported contingent resources in its interest in the Kisaran Production Sharing Contract in Sumatra, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas announced prospective resources for its 50 per cent share of its operated Barque prospect off the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full disclosure is attached.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>De-listing of New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas from ASX</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/de-listing-of-new-zealand-oil-and-gas-from-asx/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has today applied to ASX Limited (ASX) for removal from the official list of ASX. The Company will continue to be listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) and trading on the NZX will continue after the ASX delisting process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Rodger Finlay said, “For 34 consecutive years since our company was founded NZX has provided a reliable, well-regulated platform with ample liquidity for our shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board of directors has noted that trading in the company’s shares on the ASX consistently suffers from poor liquidity and low daily trading volumes. Delisting is also consistent with other recently announced initiatives to reduce costs. The Board considers that the cost of continued listing on ASX outweighs the benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-principle advice received from ASX (attached) indicates that ASX will consent to the delisting, subject to compliance with certain conditions. The company intends to fully comply with these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ASX approves the delisting, trading in the company&#039;s shares will ultimately be suspended, and shareholders will no longer be able to trade their shares in the company on ASX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following suspension of trade in the company&#039;s shares, the company will be delisted, and shareholdings remaining on the company&#039;s Australian register will be transferred to the company&#039;s New Zealand register. No date for suspension of the company&#039;s shares or delisting has been agreed between the company and ASX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the company&#039;s removal from the official list of ASX the company will remain incorporated in New Zealand, and will continue to be subject to the relevant corporate and securities laws of New Zealand as well as the rules and regulations of the Financial Markets Authority. Ordinary shares in the company will continue to be listed on NZX and will continue to be subject to the NZX Listing Rules. Copies of the company&#039;s market releases and other relevant corporate information will continue to be available at www.nzog.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas will write to all shareholders to provide a timetable for delisting and explain how shareholders can continue to trade shares in the company on the NZX after the company is removed from the official list of ASX. Delisting will not take place any earlier than one month after the date this information has been sent to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kaheru PEP 52181</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The joint venture in PEP 52181 (Kaheru), offshore South Taranaki, has submitted an&lt;br&gt;application to surrender the permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Operator New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas announced in February that economic conditions could not&lt;br&gt;support drilling the prospect before the commitment date of May 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;After exploring options to defer or amend work obligations, the joint venture has submitted to&lt;br&gt;the regulator an application to surrender the permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The permit is held by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (35%, Operator), TAG Oil (40%) and Beach&lt;br&gt;Energy (25%).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Share Buyback</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/share-buyback/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited today announces, pursuant to NZX Main Board Listing Rule 7.6.2, the intention to buy back up to 64 million fully paid ordinary shares under section 63 of the Companies Act and pursuant to the approval of shareholders received at the special meeting of shareholders held on 28 August 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board consider s that the market price of the  company’s shares is lower than is justified by the underlying value of the company’s assets and therefore that all shareholders would benefit if shares a re bought and cancelled by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has 338,180,618 listed ordinary shares. While the maximum number of shares that may be acquired in the buyback is 64 million, whether shares are bought back at all will depend on the market conditions and other factors prevailing at the relevant time. The company will regularly reassess the situation and seek to purchase shares at prices that in its view represent the best value for shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disclosure notice , required by the NZ Companies Act, is attached and will be sent to all shareholders as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchases under the buyback may occur no earlier than 10 working days after the date that the disclosure notice has been sent to all shareholders and may continue up until 9 March 2017, following which further notice will be provided to NZX and a refreshed disclosure notice will be issued prior to continuing under the approved buyback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>2015 Half-Year Result</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/2015-half-year-result/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas result for six months to 31 December 2015&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of $45.2 million&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change in accounting policy for the treatment of exploration assets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating cashflow surplus of $31.7 million, up by $9.0 million.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate strategy adjusted to account for oil prices in $30 range. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has announced a loss for the six months to 31 December 2015 of NZD$45.2 million .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asset revaluations caused by the lower oil price and changes in the capitalised value of exploration assets as a result of a change to accounting policy were the main factors in the interim financial results. The result compares with a loss of $7.7 million a year ago&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has announced a loss for the six months to 31 December 2015 of NZD$45.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset revaluations caused by the lower oil price, and changes in the capitalised value of exploration assets as a result of a change to accounting policy, were the main factors in the interim financial results. The result compares with a loss of $7.7 million a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cashflows into the business remain strong in the current financial year despite the loss, with a cash surplus from operations of $31.7 million, up by $9.0 million from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the half year the company upgraded reserves in the producing Kupe gas, LPG and light oil field by 34.7 per cent; Prospective resources of 530 million barrels were disclosed in the operated Barque prospect off the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island (unrisked, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas share 265 million); and the Pateke-4H well in the Tui oil fields is continuing to produce ahead of operator estimates after coming into production in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 16 February New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas appointed a new chairman, Mr Rodger Finlay. He  noted the company intends to make significant corporate cost savings in response to the current oil price environment as oil prices are now in the low $30 range, down from $50 oil when the company last reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board is intensifying its focus on minimising cash burn. Corporate costs will be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board intends to lead by example. The outgoing chairman will not be replaced on the Board and Directors’ fees will be reduced, providing a cost reduction of around 30 per cent as a demonstration of the Board’s determination to restructure corporate costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Exploration costs have been minimised, with no intention to spend further on exploration beyond our contractual obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The company is looking to extract more value from existing assets and continues to screen opportunities actively to grow through acquisition. The Board intends to manage capital carefully and retain only capital needed for the company’s strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite write downs of asset valuations the underlying business is performing well, and is cash positive with a strong balance sheet. I expect to see improved performance as costs are cut and growth through acquisition as assets come to market at value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Finlay paid tribute to outgoing chairman Peter Griffiths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board unanimously thanked Mr Griffiths for his long service and stewardship through a period of substantial strategic change in an extraordinary macroeconomic environment,&quot; Mr Finlay said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Knight said the first half of the financial year had seen consistent operational performance despite the lower oil price, and continues to produce enough cash to sustain it despite low oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the year the average oil price achieved was NZ$60 per barrel. At contracted gas prices the Kupe asset has positive cash flow even if oil and LPG prices were nil. Kupe gas revenues alone are more than double the operating cost of the asset,” Mr Knight said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating costs were down by $0.9 million in the half year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) was a loss of $19.6  million, compared to a profit of $7.3 million in the comparable previous period.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net group revenue was up by $11.3 million, including $28.5 million revenue contribution from Cue Energy and a $3.4 million gain on foreign exchange, offset by a negative oil price impact of $14.5 million and a negative $6.1 million from lower sales as shipments were deferred to exploit the potential for some recovery in prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of the 27.5 per cent New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas interest in the Tui oil fields has been written down by $8.7 million owing to the lower global oil price. As a result of expected lower forward oil prices the company now forecasts the field’s economic life will end in the first quarter of 2018. Tui will then be abandoned, assuming current oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration activity is now accounted for using the ‘successful efforts’ method, where exploration costs are expensed as they are incurred. In the past, exploration costs were carried as a capitalised asset and written down only at the point when the company considered there would be no prospect of success. Either accounting method is appropriate, and Directors believe the change provides an improved picture of the company’s position. Some costs will continue to be capitalised, including the cost of acquiring a permit, maintaining licences and successful drilling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has restated prior interim comparative figures and 2015 full year results as a consequence of the change in accounting policy. Details of the restatement’s impact on specific lines are included in Note 2 of the financial statements.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;All dollar amounts in NZD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further information is available in the condensed financial statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has more than 13,000 shareholders on the NZX and ASX. It has interests in three producing fields in New Zealand, and production in Indonesia and the United States. Its Clipper permit off New Zealand’s South Island East Coast contains New Zealand’s largest announced hydrocarbon prospect. More information can be found at nzog.com&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kupe reserves upgrade</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/kupe-reserves-upgrade/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas notes an upgrade in reserves in the Kupe gas and light oil field in South Taranaki, New Zealand has been announced by joint venture partner Genesis Energy Limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis Energy announced its 33 per cent upgrade following a review by international&lt;br&gt;consultancy Gaffney Cline &amp;amp; Associates. The upgrade is broadly aligned with the upgrade announced on 27 October by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas following its own internal review (with a variation relating to predicted end of field life, resulting from varying economic assumptions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 15% interest in Kupe. The other Kupe partners are Origin&lt;br&gt;Energy, 50% (Operator); Genesis Energy, 31%; and Mitsui, 4%.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Chief Executive’s Address, New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas Annual Meeting 2015</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/chief-executives-address-new-zealand-oil-and-gas-annual-meeting-2015/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Te Wharewaka Function Centre, Odlins Square, Jervois Quay, Wellington, 10:00am Thursday, 29 October 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, our chairman addressed our annual meeting and set out a revised strategy for the company responding to our current context of lower oil prices and the prospect of opportunities in the market that the context has created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas had held a substantial cash balance on our books for several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the oil price in sharp decline we could see that we would not be needing the cash to fund further exploration. Instead, we would need to concentrate on optimising our existing assets, trimming our costs to the times and looking for opportunities to take advantage of value dislocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past year, therefore, has been about the execution of our strategy. As a result, your company is in a sound position for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall during the year, the company continued to generate cash as increases in volumes offset lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started out the year by returning over $62 million in cash to you. What that cash result shows you is that if we need to come to you for cash to finance expansion plans in future, you will know that we don&#039;t hold on to your money when we don&#039;t have a near term use for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason we were able to return capital was that we could see that we would rebuild our reserves quickly as the Pateke-4H well came into production in the Tui field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time as the capital return we took a strategic stake in Cue Energy, and then grew that to a controlling interest. Cue has been working through its strategy review and I expect to see cost savings, as well as further cash being generated from its Maari asset as that comes back into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important pieces of work we have performed during the year has been in the Kupe joint venture. We were able to announce last summer that we expected Kupe reserves to increase as a result of down hole work which showed the reservoirs performing better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we were able to confirm that, following our review, we have increased the company’s share of 2P developed Kupe reserves by 34.7 per cent above those carried at 30 June 2015, from 4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent to 5.6 million barrels today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reserves increase not only provides additional volume from within the existing development but it’s likely that contracted volumes can be met without the need for Kupe reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the upgrade in Kupe developed reserves, the joint venture is still looking at opportunities around undeveloped resources. That work is expected to be completed in the second quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very pleasing improvement in our top asset, and a pleasing reward for shareholders after a difficult year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other pleasing announcement we made in recent months was the size of the prospect we are looking at in the Clipper permit off the Canterbury coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was announced in June 2015 as having a mid-range estimate of prospective resource equivalent to 530 million barrels of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective, the Barque prospect could hold at least 2 times the amount of producible gas as the Maui discovery originally contained offshore Taranaki if it comes in as estimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working hard to bring in farm out partners who would have the scale and expertise to drill a well in 800 metres of water, where Barque is located about 30 kilometres out to sea from Oamaru. The global companies we have been talking to have been impressed with the quality of our technical work. This is not an easy time to be farming out as oil companies everywhere pull back on exploration activity, so the fact we have been able to attract interest is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a lot more work to do, but I am excited by this progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in Kupe reserves and the more long-term Barque prospect help to provide some offset to the impact of declining oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most obvious impacts in the past year was the effect on our carrying valuation for the Tui field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from oil sales at Tui was actually up last year - by 54 per cent - mainly because the new Pateke-4H well began production in April. The well is performing better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Tui is in its decline phase and the lower oil price has the effect of bringing forward the date when it is estimated that it will be no longer economic. So the impact of the lower price is two-fold - both lower revenue from production, and a shorter period for production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $36 million write-down in our Tui valuation for the full year pushed the company&#039;s headline net result for the year into negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall for the business for the year, higher sales volumes from our assets offset lower oil prices and cashflow into the business remains strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebitdax (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exploration) was $77 million, up from $75 million the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the company has pulled back on costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exposure to exploration is being carefully managed to match the reduced risk tolerance in this part of the pricing cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We surrendered low priority permits, and we no longer expect to drill at Kaheru early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are carefully managing corporate admin costs as well, with head office staff numbers down from over 30 at the time of this meeting last year to 26 today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in a position to use our cash flows and balance sheet to acquire more assets if we see opportunities to buy barrels of oil that present value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we are actively screening opportunities, I am prepared to be patient to ensure shareholder value is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, our major asset, Kupe, is in good shape, with a recent large increase in reserves and the prospect of more coming in the new year. Costs are being controlled, we are managing our exposure to exploration. We are looking for further assets. And our acquisition of Cue is set to generate synergy gains and further returns from production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of room for upside and growth in our valuation. We have adapted to a tough environment and we can prosper from the opportunities available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first joined the board of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas in 2008, about three years before I became CEO. That makes me the longest serving board member. During the year our board undertook a review as part of our normal cycle of best practice in corporate governance. One issue we identified is that it&#039;s not best practice for the chief executive to be part of the board to which I report, and therefore I have withdrawn from my role on the board. My position as ceo is unchanged. So I would like to close by thanking you for the considerable privilege of continuing to serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming year I expect to continue weathering the global downturn with good cash flows and increased production, keeping tight control of costs and positioning to capture further value for shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Chairman’s Address, New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas Annual Meeting 2015</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/2015-annual-meeting-chairmans-address/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Te Wharewaka Function Centre, Odlins Square, Jervois Quay, Wellington, 10:00am Thursday, 29 October 2015&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the 2015 New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the shareholders in the room, we have received proxies and postal votes for more than 122 million shares representing 36% of the company’s capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quorum is present and so I would like to call the meeting to order, and introduce your board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Peter Griffiths. I am the chairman of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly I will ask Mr Andrew Knight to speak to you and review the company&#039;s performance in the year past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by shareholders’ questions. We have received some questions in advance of the meeting. After those we will take discussion from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have three resolutions to vote on, including two directors who are making themselves available for re-election - Mr Finlay and Mr Tume. We will hear from both of them and you will have the opportunity to put questions to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting we ask you to join us for a cup of tea, and there will be an opportunity to meet management and directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One topic I know you will want to raise is the effect of the oil price on the business, and how we are responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil prices seem to have settled at around US$50. The World Energy Council recently surveyed more than a thousand energy leaders around the world, and they said the number one issue keeping them awake at night is price volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, global demand for energy is continuing to rise by around 2 per cent a year and expert commentators generally predict a rising price in the future. When prices will begin to rise again is uncertain, and therefore we are planning on prices being lower for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is the same broad scenario expected when we met last year. I set out the board’s strategy to respond, and it remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we are looking to improve the performance of our existing producing assets. It was pleasing to be able to announce yesterday that our reserves in the Kupe field have been upgraded by around 35 per cent, which is a demonstration of the success of our focus on optimising our production assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we expect to maintain our exploration spend at very modest levels for the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploration activity we do conduct is prudently re-focused on prospects that have robust economics at lower price levels. This drives attention in two directions: Seeking larger opportunities; and also seeking opportunities where costs of exploration are lower or where prices are better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently you have seen our emphasis on the Canterbury basin where we have large opportunities, such as the Barque prospect where we announced world-scale volumes of prospective resource; And at the same time we are continuing our work in onshore Indonesia where costs are lower and demand for energy and gas prices remain strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third leg to our strategy is to seek to buy undervalued assets where we can add value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fall in oil prices has stressed many of our competitors. As they redraw their balance sheets to cope with changing circumstances, we expect to see a flow of asset sales. So far this has taken longer to occur than we thought it would but more opportunities are emerging. We are prepared to be patient to ensure we can obtain value and we will continue to look for assets that fit with our current portfolio and offer potential for growth in reserves and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our on market purchase of 48% of Cue Energy is a good example. Cue brings us additional production in New Zealand through its interest in the Maari oil field. It also has production in Indonesia. Our interest in Cue also allows us to share costs across a wider portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, we are preparing for the present oil price environment to continue, and responding by optimising our efforts, prudently focusing our exploration efforts and keeping spending on exploration at very modest levels while we look to buy more assets where we can achieve value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are confident that this strategy will serve us well in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing I would like to thank you for your support of the company during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now ask Andrew Knight to speak to the year&#039;s results in some detail and then we will take questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>34.7% Increase in Kupe Developed Reserves</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/34-7-increase-in-kupe-developed-reserves/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has materially upgraded its developed reserves in the Kupe gas and light oil field off Taranaki, New Zealand. Following a review by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, the company’s 2P developed reserves have increased by 34.7 per cent, from 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent to 5.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reserves increase not only provides additional volume from within the existing development but it’s expected that contracted volumes will be able to be supplied without the need for significant additional capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas chief executive Andrew Knight says the reserves upgrade is significant news for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Optimising performance in existing assets is a strategic priority for New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas. Kupe is a quality asset and it is pleasing to announce an increase in reserves that does not require additional capital to realise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undeveloped reserves of 3.2 million barrels, which were included in the company’s total Kupe 2P reserves at 30 June 2015, are the subject of further work to assess options for developing potential additional reserves. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas believes the undeveloped reserves will remain in line with this estimate, if the existing development plans are carried forward. The additional work may provide material additional reserves provided economic assessments support development. An update of the total developed and undeveloped reserves will be provided on completion of this work, which is expected in the second quarter of 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas earned $62.5 million in revenue from Kupe in the 2014-15 financial year. Its share of production from Kupe was 242,417 barrels of oil, 3.6 petajoules of gas, and 15,391 tonnes of LPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 15% interest in Kupe. The other Kupe partners are Origin Energy, 50% (Operator); Genesis Energy, 31%; and Mitsui, 4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserves are quantities of petroleum anticipated to be commercially recoverable from known accumulations from a given date forward; that are judged to be discovered, recoverable, commercial and remaining. Probable (2P) reserves have a 50 per cent chance or better of being technically and economically producible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed reserves are expected to be recovered from existing wells and facilities. Undeveloped reserves are quantities expected to be recovered through future investments (e.g. new wells, compressors, and other facilities). Total reserves are the sum of developed and undeveloped reserves at a given level of certainty. Oil and gas reserves reported in this statement are as at 1 October 2015. The Kupe estimate is based on production data and compositional simulation models provided by the field operator, Origin Energy. It is the result of deterministic reservoir simulation modelling, matched with full production history on a well-by-well basis, in addition to decline curve analysis, supported by rate transient analysis, and both flowing and static material balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates of reserves are based on their value in use with a discount rate of 10% applied. The oil price assumptions are based on the Bloomberg consensus mean, with contracted volumes of gas and LPG sold on current contract terms. For volumes in excess of current contracts, a future base market price of $6/gigajoule is assumed for gas sales and LPG prices are linked to the Bloomberg consensus mean forecast for oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reserves statement is approved by, based on, and fairly represents information and supporting documentation prepared by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Vice President &amp;amp; General Manager, Exploration &amp;amp; Production Andrew Jefferies, B Eng (Mech Hons), MSc Pet Eng, MBE, and SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Certified Petroleum Engineer with over 23 years of industry experience.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Targeted Share Buy Back</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/targeted-share-buy-back/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time employees of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited (NZOG) (or a company within the NZOG group) are offered partly paid shares in NZOG pursuant to an Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trustee, NZOG Services Limited, holds those shares on trust until such time as the employee is transferred legal ownership of the shares in accordance with the rules of the ESOP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trustee is required to sell the shares held for an employee if the employee&#039;s interest in the shares is forfeited. This may happen, for example, where the employee&#039;s employment is terminated or they do not pay the balance of the issue price due for the shares under the rules of the ESOP. The Trustee&#039;s current practice is to sell these forfeited shares on-market, however this can have a negative effective on the market price of NZOG shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative option, the directors of NZOG have resolved that NZOG may buy back some or all of the ESOP shares required to be sold by the Trustee (Targeted Shares), off-market (Buy Back Offers). The consideration to be paid for the shares under the Buy Back Offers will be a price within the buy and sell quotes of NZOG shares trading on NZX Main Board at any time on the date of acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NZOG makes the following notifications in accordance with Listing Rule 7.6.2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. NZOG will make Buy Back Offers as described above in the period from 14 October 2015 to 28 September 2016 (Offer Period).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The Targeted Shares are ordinary shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. The maximum number of Targeted Shares to be acquired by NZOG under Buy Back Offers during the Offer Period will be 2,000,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas Annual Result for the full year to 2015.</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-zealand-oil-and-gas-annual-result-for-the-full-year-to-2015/</link>
			<description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Revenue up 12% to $116.2m; Ebitdax up $1.5m to $77.1m; Net loss $6.2m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased sales volumes offset lower oil prices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful acquisition of Cue adds to performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploration spending reduced from $75m to $32m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas financial results for the year to 30 June 2015 show increased sales volumes have offset lower oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the 2014-15 year was up by $12.6 million, from $103.6 million last year, to $116.2 million. Consolidation of Cue Energy contributed $11.1 million. Revenue excluding Cue remained steady. (All figures NZD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ebitdax (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exploration) was $77.1 million, up from $75.4 million the previous year. Gross profit was $39.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A net loss after tax of $6.2 million for the year was recorded, compared to a net profit after tax of $10.1 million in the previous year. The loss includes a write-down of $36.3 million for the full year in the value of the company’s interest in the Tui oil fields. The carrying value was impaired because lower oil prices have brought forward the date when production from Tui is expected to become uneconomic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is actively seeking M&amp;amp;A opportunities, more value from its Kupe asset, tighter control of costs and reduced spending on exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Kupe was steady, with increased sales volumes and favourable currency movement offset by price impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from oil sales at Tui was up by 54 per cent on a sales volume increase of 124 per cent, mainly because the new Pateke-4H well began production in April. The well is performing better than expected, which contributed to an increase in shipments. Pateke-4H lowered the average production cost per unit sold, and increased amortisation costs in line with production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cashflow from operations was strong, at $59.3 million. The company had $83.7 million of cash at the end of the year and no debt. In February $63.2 million of capital was returned to shareholders, which resulted in one in five shares being cancelled in return for paying shareholders 75 cents per share cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall for the year, the company’s operating costs and amortisation were up by $28.8 million to $76.5 million. The main factors in the operating cost increase were higher amortisation costs in line with Pateke production, a foreign exchange impact, and the company’s increased interest in Tui which is reflected in the full year compared to three quarters in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the industry is working through the impact of declining oil prices, valuations and production levels are dependent on future oil prices and asset valuations could be further impaired in the future if lower oil prices are sustained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company expensed $15.6 million after surrendering three exploration permits off Taranaki during the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue’s ebitdax for the three months since effective control was gained was $5.0 million, after significant one-off expenses incurred on its takeover defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Knight says higher volumes of oil and gas during the year have offset lower oil prices, and revenue rose in the year with the acquisition of Cue Energy contributing to the increased revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cashflow into the business remains strong. Volume increases have offset lower prices. “Our cash flows and balance sheet provide the opportunity to acquire under-valued assets. Our screening has identified opportunities where significant value is available. While there are further opportunities in the market we are prepared to be patient to ensure shareholder value is enhanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are looking to optimise existing assets. We have identified opportunities in the Kupe asset. The well intervention programme early in 2015 has shown early positive signs of well performance improvement, and the joint venture is continuing to review resources and a field development plan. We are assessing whether opportunities in the permit have the potential to be developed and the most efficient means to further optimise recovery from existing wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Exposure to exploration is being carefully managed to match the reduced risk tolerance in this part of the pricing cycle. Some legacy commitments exist in our portfolio to be worked through and I expect Cue Energy to undertake a strategic and portfolio review shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is weathering the global downturn in prices with good cash flows and increased production. I expect to see more value from our producing assets in the coming year. We will continue to keep tight control of costs in the current conditions and position to capture value for shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Management Resignation</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/management-resignation/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Vice President and General Manager Commercial, John Bay, has announced he will leave the company at the end of August to pursue other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Knight paid tribute to Mr Bay, who joined the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas executive team in February 2012 after previously consulting to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is an industry leader. Since immigrating to New Zealand in 1990 he has held senior management positions in a variety of energy companies, he is an experienced director of public and private companies, and a former chair of the industry organisation, Pepanz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;John is a senior oil and gas industry figure with more than 35 years experience, and I wish&lt;br&gt;him all the best as he moves to the new opportunities he has planned.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Tui Oil Shipment</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/tui-oil-shipment/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas advises 604,736 barrels of oil from the Tui field offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, were lifted and shipped last week. (166,302 barrels net to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume reflects increased production from Tui resulting from the Pateke-4H field coming into production in the current quarter. Revenue from the shipment will be recognised in the current quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui. The other Tui joint venture partners are AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5 per cent and Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Kisaran plan of development approved</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/kisaran-plan-of-development-approved/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Ministerial approval has been received for a Plan of Development of the Kisaran Production Sharing Contract in Sumatra, Indonesia, where New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 22.5 per cent interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two wells were successfully drilled there, in the Parit Minyak prospect, in 2013. A Plan of Development for the field was developed in 2014 and forwarded for government approval early this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministerial approval extends the Production Sharing Contract until 2031.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approved plan would see up to seven wells at Parit Minyak as the initial phase of development. A low cost development is anticipated, using both rented and permanent facilities and trucking the oil to nearby facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture expects to finalise an execution plan for the development before a final investment decision later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Ltd has a 22.5 per cent stake in the joint venture through its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd. The Kisaran Joint Venture partners are Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (55 per cent and Operator) and Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Sumatera) Ltd, a subsidiary of Bukit Energy Inc. (22.5 per cent).&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Revocation of Notice of Meeting</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/revocation-of-notice-of-meeting/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;On 30 April 2015 New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas sent shareholders a notice of a special meeting of shareholders to be held on Thursday, 21 May 2015 to vote on a proposed share buyback programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notice has been withdrawn because the Takeovers Panel has advised it considers that the notice does not adequately describe the persons whose voting control may increase as a result of the buyback. The Panel believes that the omission is material information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently there will be no meeting on 21 May 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is considering whether to reschedule the special meeting, or whether to seek the relevant approvals at the annual meeting later in the year, and will notify shareholders once a decision has been made.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Production begins at Pateke-4H well</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/production-begins-at-pateke-4h-well/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The subsea tie-back and installation project to connect the Pateke-4H well to the Tui area oil fields in PMP 38158 has been successfully completed and oil production has commenced, the operator has advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pateke-4H well has been brought onto production and flow testing is under way to determine the optimal well settings. The well recorded an initial unstabilised flow rate of 34,000 bopd at 67 per cent choke with a 48 per cent water cut, which is in line with field modelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, it is planned to test various facility parameters, including choke settings, before establishing a much lower stabilised flow rate for long-term production. It is forecast that oil production from the well will then decline relative to the increasing water cut in the well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pateke-4H subsea tie-back and installation project commenced on 5 March 2015. The project involved the installation of 1,312 metres of flexible flow line, a gas lift umbilical and production manifold, integrated controls and ancillary equipment in water depths of about 124 metres. All infrastructure was successfully tested and commissioned prior to starting production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tie-back and installation was completed with no safety or environmental incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tui area oil fields and the Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel, Umuroa, were shut in for the duration of the tie-back project. During the shut-in period, a planned program of facility inspections and maintenance was conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in PMP 38158 via subsidiaries. The joint venture are AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator), 57.50 per cent; and Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries), 15 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Changes in senior management</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/changes-in-senior-management/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two changes have been made to the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas senior management team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Jefferies, who was previously Vice President of Operations and Engineering will takeover responsibility for exploration and becomes Vice President for Exploration and Production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Chris McKeown joins the senior management team as General Manager, Southeast Asia. He was previously Business Development Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas chief executive Andrew Knight says the appointments align the company’s management with its focus on cost effectiveness and maximising value from its current portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are focusing on creating more value from our existing assets with a more efficient and cost effective structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this environment it makes sense to combine responsibility for our exploration and operations activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is also the right time to establish a new role with responsibility for managing our assets located outside New Zealand following our drilling success in the Kisaran production sharing contract and the expansion of our portfolio in Sumatra.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr McKeown joined New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas in 2012. He has previously been chief executive of a start-up oil company, asset manager of a producing oil field, and general manager of a gas exploration company. Chris moved to New Zealand in 2002 after working in business development and reservoir engineering in the UK. He has PhD in Geology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Jefferies started his career with Shell in Australia after graduating with a BEng (Mechanical Hons) from the University of Sydney in 1991. He has worked in Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Thailand and Holland, in operations and petroleum engineering. He has an MBA (technology management) from Deakin University in Australia, and an MSc (Petroleum Engineering) from Heriot-Watt University in Scotland. He joined New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas in early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Pateke-4H subsea tie-back underway</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-subsea-tie-back-underway/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Operator of the Tui oil fields in PMP 38158 has announced that the Pateke-4H subsea tie-back and installation project has commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pateke-4H was drilled horizontally to 4,772 metres last year. The Pateke structure is one of three producing in the Tui field offshore Taranaki, New Zealand. The 4H well accessed a lobe not being drained by the existing Pateke well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday the DOF Subsea Diving Support Vessel, Skandi Singapore, arrived to commence the tie-back project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involves installing subsea pipelines, manifolds and ancillary support equipment in water depths of about 124 metres to connect the Pateke-4H development well to the Tui field gathering system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #565656; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;&quot;&gt;The subsea tie-back and installation project will coincide with a two week planned inspection and maintenance shut down of the FPSO, Umuroa. First production from Pateke-4H is expected in April.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in the Tui field. The Joint Venture partners are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.42857;&quot; data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;• &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.42857;&quot; data-mce-mark=&quot;1&quot;&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sales of gas are continuing to sustain strong, positive cashflows which New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is using to focus on acquisitions against a background of lower oil prices affecting valuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue for the six months to 31 December 2014 was up 5.2 per cent to $54.1 million from $51.4 million a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue figures were primarily driven by additional volumes from the company’s larger share of the Tui asset for the duration of the current six month period and the timing of shipments, but significantly lower oil prices largely offset any volume gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from the Kupe asset in the six months was $31.4 million from production of around 450,000 barrels of oil equivalent1, compared to $38.0 million a year ago from 472,000 barrels in 2014 and $31.2 million from 368,000 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Tui was $22.7 million in the half year from around 227,000 barrels of oil sold, compared to $13.4 million a year ago from 97,000 barrels sold, when the larger share was only included in three months’ production, and $16.6 million in 2013 from 82,750 barrels sold. Revenue is affected by the timing of shipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross profit for the six months was $20.9 million compared with $26.7 million in same period last year. The increase in operating costs was the result of the greater stake in Tui and the lower New Zealand dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the six months to 31 December, EBITDAX2 (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exploration expenses) was $28.3 million, compared to $31.4 million in the first half of the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A net loss of $10.5 million was recorded for the six months after the Tui asset was written down by $13 million because of lower oil prices. In the same period last year the company announced a net profit after tax of $4.0 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite lower oil prices, the company expects gas sales volumes and prices to provide continued positive cashflows, while revenue will be further supported by additional production from the Pateke-4H well. The Pateke operator expects work to begin in March to connect Pateke-4H to the Tui floating production vessel, with first oil now anticipated as early as April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Andrew Knight says despite the effects of lower oil prices the underlying business is sound with positive cash flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oil prices affect revenue and the Tui valuation but our revenue from gas sales has not been affected in the same way. I expect the business’s performance to continue to be fundamentally sound with our mix of assets and the business overall remaining cashflow positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The lower oil price has resulted in a number of assets coming to market. This represents an opportunity to use our positive cashflows for acquisitions where opportunities present value for shareholders.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company intends to pull back on future exploration and expensed $13.5 million after returning two permits off Taranaki, New Zealand to the Crown. The exploration spend for the half-year compares to $12.5 million in the comparable previous period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had no debt and $115.2 million of cash at 31 December 2014. On 20 February the company will return around $63.2 million of capital to shareholders. It also used $14.7 million of cash to purchase a 19.99 per cent interest in ASX-listed Cue Energy, and last week made a takeover offer of A10 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIGURES ARE NZD, except where stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated as the total oil equivalent of the oil, condensate/light oil, natural gas and LPG figures, using conversion factors consistent with Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) guidelines, as provided below. Conversion factors used were: 163.40 barrels of oil equivalent per terajoule of natural gas, 8.15 barrels of oil equivalent per tonne of LPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 EBITDAX is a non-IFRS measure that is presented to provide an understanding of the underlying operating performance of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited. The measure represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exploration costs (including impairment write downs and abandonment) and reconciles with ‘Net loss after tax‘ as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Unconditional takeover offer of Cue Energy Resources Limited </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/unconditional-takeover-offer-of-cue-energy-resources-limited/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;NZOG Offshore, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, is making an unconditional takeover offer for ASX-listed Cue Energy Resources Limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The on-market cash offer of A$0.10 per share expires at the end of trading on the ASX on 27 March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the Bidder’s Statement is attached and will be sent to Cue Energy shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas believes Cue&#039;s major asset, a 5 per cent interest in the Maari oil field in New Zealand, is a quality asset that fits our portfolio well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, through NZOG Offshore, made an off-market purchase of 19.99 per cent of Cue Energy from Todd Petroleum at the same price, for a total value of A$13.96 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is New Zealand’s largest publicly-listed explorer Established in 1981 and listed on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges, it has two major producing assets offshore Taranaki New Zealand and exploration interests in New Zealand and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Capital return final court orders</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/capital-return-final-court-orders/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has received final High Court orders approving a return of capital by way of a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 15 of the Companies Act 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 21 November 2014 New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas announced that it had received initial orders from the High Court to seek shareholder approval to return approximately $60 million of capital to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas held a special meeting of shareholders on Friday, 19 December 2014 to vote on the proposed capital return. The resolution was carried with approximately 97% support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has also received a favourable binding ruling from IRD confirming that the proposed return of capital will not be treated as a dividend for New Zealand tax purposes and therefore will not be subject to tax in New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will cancel 1 in every 5 ordinary shares and pay NZ$0.75 per ordinary share cancelled– effectively returning 15 cents per share. Payments will be made within five business days of the date for determining the entitlements of shareholders to participate in the Scheme (13 February 2015).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, shareholders will receive approximately NZ$63.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian shareholders will receive an AUD equivalent per cancelled share based on the NZD/AUD exchange rate on or about the record date. A summary of the tax impact for Australian shareholders was contained in the Notice of Meeting sent to all shareholders (available at http://nzog.today/capital-return/explanatory-notes/ ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part-paid shares issued as part of the company’s Employee Share Ownership Plan will not participate in the Scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Positive indications in Kupe testing</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/positive-indications-in-kupe-testing/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Preliminary results of testing at the Kupe gas and oil field , offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, demonstrated improved well productivity and access to previously untapped gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results will require further analysis and production data measurement to provide the certainty required to update reserves. This work should be completed by the end of the current financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas reported in 2014 that work had begun to assess prospects for recovery of additional resources from Kupe and to assess the potential for additional field development opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kupe operator, Origin Energy, performed tests in December and January to gather information in support of an update to the field development plan. Measurements were taken of fluid contacts. Additional perforations were added below existing ones in two wells to enhance production and reservoir recovery. The operation was logistically complex but was executed on time, under-budget and without health or safety incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early test results are positive, with increased gas and condensate rates and higher shut-in wellhead pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial analysis of logging results indicates the water contact has not moved as much as modelling predicted. This means ultimate recovery from existing reservoirs may be higher than forecast to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the higher shut-in well head pressures indicate that previously untapped gas reserves may be available, trapped beneath shale layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post re-perforation productivity more than doubled in the KS8 well– the least productive well in the Kupe field. Results also indicate additional productivity in the KS6 well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the Kupe joint venture partners have reached agreement to maintain increased gas production capability. Since the first half of 2012, production capacity from the Kupe facility has been elevated by around 10 per cent, to up to 77 terajoules per day, with actual production averaging between 63 to 65 terajoules per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe is 30 kilometres south of the Taranaki coast and produces gas, LPG and light oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 30 June 2014 New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas reported full year revenue of NZ$75.9 million from the Kupe asset. Production volumes reported were 3.5 petajoules of gas, 0.5 million barrels of oil and 14.4 kilotonnes of LPG (all New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas share).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 15% interest in Kupe. The other Kupe partners are Origin Energy, 50% (Operator); Genesis Energy, 31%; and Mitsui, 4%.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Pateke-4H reserves</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-reserves/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas and Pan Pacific Petroleum have completed a review of the increase in Tui reserves attributable to the Pateke-4H well, and estimate a total increase in 2P recoverable reserves of 2.4  million barrels gross, 660,000 barrels net to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas as at 1 January 2015. This comprises 1.9 million barrels from the Pateke-4H accumulation and an additional 0.5 million barrels from the other Tui area fields as a result of the extension of economic field life. This estimate excludes any additional oil which will be used as fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pateke-4H estimate will be reviewed and updated when the well is on production and actual performance can be compared with the forecast from the current model. The well is scheduled to be tied into the FPSO Umuroa in  the first quarter of 2015, with production in the second quarter. The effect of Pateke-4H on the extension of the economic field life of the Tui area fields is dependent on oil price, and includes an assumption of a return to higher oil prices during the field life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui. The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Information on the Reserves and Resources in this release relating to the Pakete-4H well is based on an independent process review conducted by RISC Operations Pty Ltd (RISC), a leading independent oil and gas industry advisory firm, and fairly represents the information and supporting documentation reviewed. The review was carried out in accordance with the SPE Reserves Auditing Standards and the SPE-PRMS guidelines under the supervision of Mr. Geoffrey J Barker, a Partner of RISC. Mr. Barker is a member of the SPE and his qualifications include a Master of Engineering Science (Petroleum Engineering) from Sydney University and more than 30 years of relevant experience. Mr. Barker meets the requirements of qualified petroleum reserve and resource evaluator as defined in Chapter 19 of the ASX Listing Rules and consents to the inclusion of this information in this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement has been compiled by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Vice-President Operations and Engineering Andrew Jefferies BEng (Mech Hons), Msc Pet Eng, MBA, an SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers) Certified Petroleum Engineer with over 23 years of industry experience. The estimate is the result of probabilistic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserves are the quantities of petroleum anticipated to be commercially recoverable from known accumulations from a given date forward; that are judged to be discovered, recoverable, commercial and remaining. Probable (2P) reserves are those which have a 50% chance or better of being technically and economically producible.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>2014 Annual Meeting CEO’s address </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/2014-annual-meeting-ceos-address/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Knight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chief Executive,&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&lt;br&gt;Inter Continental Hotel, 2 Grey St, Wellington at 9.30AM Tuesday, 4 November 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operational performance over the last year has been excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is reflected in the strong production and operating cash-flow results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, revenue for the year was up by 4.7 per cent, from $99 million to $104 million. The major contributors to that revenue were production from Tui and Kupe, offset by some foreign exchange losses caused by the strength of the New Zealand dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales from Tui would have declined much more this year as the reserves in the field deplete, but in fact Tui performance was a success after we increased our share from 12.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent by buying some of Mitsui’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of that extra share has already been recovered in increased revenue compared to the revenue we would have achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production from Kupe was steady in the year, which lifted the result compared to the previous year, when there was a maintenance shut-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, gas sales contracts were accelerated, which also helped to grow returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a positive impact of just over ten million dollars from the settlement of the Kupe overriding royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognised around $10 million at year end from the settlement and it will add about $1-2 million a year to the company’s revenue in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kupe settlement dates back to agreements made when the permit was farmed out in the 80s to pay a certain share of future production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe is a fantastic asset for us, and it will continue to produce for many years. Only the gas and light oil prospects in the permit are producing, but we are still looking in the permit for oil as well as further gas and gas condensate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a focus for us in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kupe story highlights what an uncertain business exploration can be. Kupe-1 was first drilled in 1975 by Shell, BP and Todd. They had some hydrocarbon shows, but Kupe-1 was assessed as sub-commercial and plugged and abandoned, and the licence was handed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, in the 80s, oil and gas reserves were estimated at about ten per cent the size of the currently proven reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can learn from Kupe that you have to keep investing in exploration to succeed. Kupe would not have become the valuable producing asset it is today without investment patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why, in the past year, we recorded a high level of investment in exploration and evaluation - up 77 per cent from the previous year, to just under $75 million, and up from $9 million in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two exploration successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pateke-4H well will by tied back to the Tui FPSO in the new year, and begin producing before the end of the current financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of the reservoir there is still to be determined. The joint venture hasn’t come to a shared view yet but we will report our figure when we have the level of certianty required by the stock markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had drilling success at Kisaran, in Indonesia , and a plan of development is progressing towards a final invetsment decision there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quarterly activities report last week we were able to disclose for the first time that we have encountered a 1300 foot oil column, albeit one that is in stacked sands and shales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means is that a series of multiple wells will be required in to reservoirs that are disconnected and discontinuous, with varying quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would expect to start out by completing the three wells already drilled, and three new ones. Then there would be an ongoing programme of development over five to ten years where new wells would be drilled and come into production at rates of hundreds of barrels a day for a year or two, then tapering off for later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some wells will be more profitable than others, and the field would be expected to have a life of fifteen to twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian fiscal regime is very good for this sort of development. It allows you to recover your costs (and a margin). Then, once costs are recovered, the model works the other way and you recover a profit share at a lower rate. Another advantage of this model is that it protects the investment against a fall in the oil price because - if the oil price falls - you get a greater share of production until the costs and margin are recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other news we have been able to release about Indonesia has come from the Bohorok field to the north of Sumatra, where a 2D seismic survey has been completed this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This field is next to the city of Medan, where prices for gas are strong because the city has pinched gas supplies. The infrastructure is mainly in place because Bohorok is next to the Wampu gas field, which has produced at 6 to 9 million cubic feet of gas a day in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still need regulatory approvals, but we expect to drill a US$12 million well over an attractive prospect there next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can see from the Indonesia portoflio is that it compliments our New Zealand activity. The Kisaran development offers the potential to bring through new production, then there are opportunities at each further stage of exploration maturity: drilling at Bohorok, more seismic in South Sumatra and our new unconventional interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In New Zealand we are positive about the acreage we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in New Zealand’s deep water basins is elevated. It’s a matter of time before someone has some success. I want us to be positioned to be part of success when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>2014 Annual Meeting Chairman’s address</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/2014-annual-meeting-chairmans-address/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Chairman’s Address, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Annual Meeting 2014&lt;br&gt;Inter Continental Hotel, 2 Grey St, Wellington 9.30AM Tuesday, 4 November 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladies and gentlemen,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quorum is present and so I now call the meeting to order. In addition to the shareholders in the room I am advised we have received proxies and postal votes for more than 179,000,000 shares representing some 42% of the company’s capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Peter Griffiths. I have the honor of being the chairman of the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to welcome you to the 2014 New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas annual meeting, and introduce your board of directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly I will ask Mr Andrew Knight to give his presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be followed by shareholders’ questions and then we will deal with the resolutions foreshadowed in the notice of meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will hear from both of the new director nominees, and you will have the opportunity to put questions to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting we ask you to join us for a cup of tea, and there will be an opportunity to meet the management and directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew will provide you with detail of the company’s activities during year in review and something about what lies ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will confine my remarks to three areas: the board, our strategy, and capital management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Board &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our on going process of board renewal Mr David Scoffham and Mr Paul Foley are stepping down as directors at the end of this meeting. Both have given dedicated and committed support to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&lt;br&gt;through the ups and downs of the enterprise over many years. On behalf of the board I wish to record our sincere appreciation and thanks for their service. Thank you David and thank you Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I just mentioned, later in the meeting you will have the opportunity to elect two new directors: Dr Rosalind Archer and Mr Duncan Saville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their election will bring the number of new directors appointed to the board since our 2012 annual meeting to five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to the future I am confident that this refreshed board continues to encompass the range of skills and corporate experience essential for the successful and safe governance of your company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board has recently conducted a review of the company’s strategic direction and has confirmed we will continue seeking to create sustained shareholder value from a portfolio of oil and gas production and exploration assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However what will change during the next period is the focus, of our efforts, the balance in our portfolio and our style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will concentrate on two paths for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly:&lt;br&gt;ACQUISITION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We consider the current market dislocation provides significant opportunity to acquire production and reserves at attractive prices and we will seek transactions that create compelling value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly we will consider the quality of assets, the value created and the do-ability of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently we are actively reviewing a number of possibilities and we will continue to seek further opportunities as we consider the current market in our sector both locally and internationally provides us a favourable environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly:&lt;br&gt;EXPLORATION.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also continue to grow value around our portfolio of exploration acreage by increasing the focus on its optionality but we will set a higher hurdle for investing cash in exploration in to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Zealand exploration opportunity remains attractive to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has vast, under-explored basins, an acceptable financial regime, a regular process for bidding for acreage and it is attracting credible large explorers including Woodside, Shell, Anadarko, and Statoil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But New Zealand also has significant challenges for us. It is inevitably high cost due to its remoteness from major centres of oil activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its geology is challenging, with a limited dataset for such a vast area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As community interest in our activities increases, their expectations are heightened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a new regulator, the EPA. They are bedding in their new legislation and regulatory framework. This is welcomed by the industry, however new relationships do take time to develop and become effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities that New Zealand provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe we have established ourselves as the New Zealand partner of choice and our efforts to work with local communities have borne fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now an active explorer, regularly taking up and releasing acreage, maintaining a diverse portfolio of inshore and deepwater opportunities in the traditional basin of Taranaki and further afield in the Canterbury and Great South basins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside New Zealand we are very pleased with the progress our Indonesian interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development and production can be expected within the next calendar year and the results of seismic work recently carried out are likely lead to further drilling opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will enhance the focus on our costs. While we consider we currently benchmark well against competitors we will ensure we have set our overheads to a level commensurate with the operations of a safe and cost-effective company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Capital management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company has a robust balance sheet with no debt, and in the near term we expect increasing cash flows from increased levels of production at Tui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, our cash on hand will grow well beyond what the business requires for its planned activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, with a view to improving the balance sheet performance of the company the board has resolved to make a capital reduction equal to 15 cents per share, which equates to approximately $60 million. The details of this will require approval from shareholders and an extraordinary meeting will be held promptly–hopefully before Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While our cash flows will be strong, the company is not in a tax-paying position. This is largely a consequence of New Zealand exploration expenses being immediately tax deductible. We are not generating imputation credits. Consequently the board does not expect to declare dividends for the near term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, we have a refreshed board, we have refreshed strategic perspective and we will re-sharpen our focus on costs and creating an efficient balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank you for your support of the company during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will shortly hear form Andrew they have been busy and have an exciting work program for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much, and I would now like to invite Andrew Knight to speak to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Purchase of interest in Cue Energy</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/purchase-of-interest-in-cue-energy/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has agreed to purchase 19.99 per cent of shares in ASX-listed exploration and production company Cue Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holding was purchased off market from Todd Petroleum Mining at AUD10 cents per share, for a total value of AUD$13.96 million. The agreement is expected to be completed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Andrew Knight says, &quot;Cue has a 5 per cent interest in the Maari field in PMP 38160, which we view as a quality asset and exposure to it fits our portfolio well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Special Meeting of Shareholders results</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/special-meeting-of-shareholders-results/</link>
			<description>&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;One resolution was voted on by shareholders at the Special Meeting of Shareholders of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas held in Wellington this morning from 10.00am New Zealand time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;That the arrangements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;a.) relating to the return of capital to the holders of Ordinary Shares by way of a scheme of arrangement; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;b.) relating to the holders of Part-Paid Shares by way of a scheme of arrangement;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt; as set out in the Notice of Special Meeting and the Explanatory Notes, be approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;The required voting thresholds for approval of this resolution were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;a.) 75 per cent or more of the votes entitled to be cast, and cast, by holders of Ordinary Shares; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;b.) 75 per cent or more of the votes entitled to be cast, and cast, by holders of Part-Paid Shares; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;c.) a majority of all voting rights entitled to be voted on the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;The resolution was voted on by way of a poll and the result is that each required threshold, as described above, was met and accordingly the resolution was carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has received a binding ruling from Inland Revenue which has confirmed that the proposed return of capital by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas to its shareholders will not be treated as dividends and will not be subject to tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;The last condition that needs to be met for the capital return to proceed is for the final orders to be sought from and granted by the High Court approving the return of capital by a Scheme of Arrangement under Part 15 of the Companies Act 1993.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Change in Indonesia permit and acquisition of additional rights</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/change-in-indonesia-permit-and-acquisition-of-additional-rights/</link>
			<description>&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;Lion Energy has been granted an option to acquire a 15 per cent interest in the conventional Bohorok Production Sharing Contract in North Sumatra, Indonesia, in exchange for the Bohorok partners receiving a 45 per cent interest in an unconventional Joint Study Agreement over virtually the same area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;If the option is exercised, the transaction would value the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas interest in the conventional Bohorok PSC at approximately 1.4 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;The conventional Bohorok PSC was signed in 2012 and entitles the partners to explore for and develop conventional oil and gas accumulations. A 206 square kilometre seismic survey over the block was completed this year and a decision to drill a well is expected in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;If Lion elects to exercise its option, Lion will reimburse the Bohorok partners for 15 per cent of the back costs, including the costs of the recent seismic survey, plus pay a capped carry amount for the seismic costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;Following the transaction, if Lion exercises its option, each party will have the following share in the Bohorok conventional PSC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;38.25% (Previously 45%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bukit Energy (Operator) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;38.25% (Previously 45%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surya Buana Lestarijaya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.50%* (Previously 10%)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lion Energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the unconventional JSA, Lion&#039;s previous 100% interest will become:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lion Energy  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;55%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bukit Energy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20.25%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20.25%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surya Buana Lestarijaya&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.5%*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;If the Joint Study Agreement is awarded over the unconventional, the Bohorok partners will reimburse Lion for back costs and contribute 45 per cent of third party costs of conducting the Joint Study.  At the completion of the Joint Study, each party has an option to jointly participate in the direct award bid round for the unconventional PSC that will be announced by the Indonesian regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;Lion will operate the Joint Study.  Bukit will be the initial operator of the unconventional PSC, if it is awarded, until the completion of the 3-year firm work commitment, at which time operatorship will be reviewed and, if Lion still holds 51 per cent of the PSC then, it may become operator subject to regulator approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MainBodyText&quot;&gt;*Bukit and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas have entered into an agreement with SBL to jointly acquire its interests in both the PSC and Joint Study Agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Share Buy-Back and Update on the Scheme of Arrangement</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/share-buy-back-and-update-on-the-scheme-of-arrangement/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/2014/Share-buy-back-and-Scheme-update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Download a copy of this news release here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas intends to put in place arrangements allowing it to buy back its shares. It will ask shareholders for approval to exempt its major shareholder from having to sell down its holding if the share buy-back goes ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#039;s board believes the company’s share price does not reflect the underlying value of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share purchases would be on-market. The timing and quantity would be decided by the board from time to time after considering capital requirements and market prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a buy back goes ahead then it&#039;s likely that the proportion of shares held by the company’s major shareholder, Zeta Energy Pte Ltd, would increase above 20 per cent as a result of the acquired shares being cancelled. 20 per cent is the threshold set in the New Zealand Takeovers Code at which Zeta would be required to sell down its holding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeta and its associates currently hold 19.87 per cent. At this time, Zeta is the only shareholder likely to be affected by the threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board believes it is not appropriate for a shareholder to be forced to sell down as a result of the share buy-back. Consequently the  company plans to use procedures available under the Listing Rules and Takeovers Code that allow an exemption from the threshold. These procedures would allow other shareholders to approve an increase in Zeta&#039;s shareholding percentage (where the increase is a result of other shares being acquired by the company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the proposal together with an independent appraisal report will be prepared and sent to shareholders in the new year prior to a shareholder meeting expected in the first quarter next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proposal is distinct from the return of capital that will be voted on by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas shareholders at a Special General Meeting on Friday. When the deadline passed this morning for online and postal voting, and for appointing a proxy for the meeting, voting and proxy voting instructions indicated the resolution would be passed. Subsequent to Friday’s meeting the capital return will still require a binding ruling on its tax effect, and final court approval.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Capital return interim orders received</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/capital-return-interim-orders-received/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has received initial orders from the High Court to seek shareholder&lt;br&gt;approval to return approximately $60 million of capital to its shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas announced the capital return on 4 November 2014, and on 19&lt;br&gt;November sought initial orders from the High Court to convene a meeting of shareholders to consider a scheme of arrangement to cancel 1 in 5 of its shares and to return $0.75 per&lt;br&gt;cancelled share. Shares that have been issued as part of the Employee Share Ownership&lt;br&gt;Plan will not participate in the return of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If shareholders approve the scheme, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas intends to seek final orders&lt;br&gt;sanctioning the scheme from the High Court under Part XV of the Companies Act 1993.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special meeting of shareholders will be organised before Christmas 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Directors’ independence and Deed of Indemnity</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/directors-independence-and-deed-of-indemnity/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Two new directors were elected to the board of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited last week, Dr Rosalind Archer and Mr Duncan Saville. The company is entering into its standard form of indemnity in favour of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The board has determined, pursuant to NZX Listing Rules 3.3.2 and 3.3.3, that Dr Rosalind Archer is an independent director and Mr Duncan Saville is not an independent director because he is a director of a substantial security holder of the company.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;h2&gt;Four resolutions were voted on by shareholders at the Annual Meeting of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas held in Wellington this morning from 9.30AM New Zealand time.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;That the Company’s Board of Directors be authorised to fix the auditor’s remuneration. Carried at the meeting on a show of hands.&lt;br&gt;Proxy and postal votes received were:&lt;br&gt;For and discretionary: 169,522,644&lt;br&gt;Against: 12,158,641&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Dr R Archer be elected as a Director. Carried at the meeting on a show of hands.&lt;br&gt;Proxy and postal votes received were:&lt;br&gt;For and discretionary: 163,507,456&lt;br&gt;Against: 796,376&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Mr D Saville be elected as a Director. Carried at the meeting on a show of hands.&lt;br&gt;Proxy and postal votes received were:&lt;br&gt;For and discretionary: 180,852,337&lt;br&gt;Against: 872,404&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chairman, Peter Griffiths, made announcements at the meeting relating to capital&lt;br&gt;management, which are reproduced below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Capital Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The company has a robust balance sheet with no debt, and in the near term we expect&lt;br&gt;increasing cash flows from increased levels of production at Tui. Consequently, our cash on hand will grow well beyond what the business requires for its planned activities.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Accordingly, with a view to improving the balance sheet performance of the company the board has resolved to make a capital reduction equal to 15 cents per share, which equates to approximately $60 million. The details of this will require approval from shareholders and an extraordinary meeting will be held promptly – hopefully before Christmas.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chairman also made announcements relating to dividends:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Dividends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;While our cash flows will be strong, the company is not in a tax-paying position. This is&lt;br&gt;largely a consequence of New Zealand exploration expenses being immediately tax&lt;br&gt;deductible. We are not generating imputation credits.

			<title>Amendment to Parent Company Financial Results – Group Results Unchanged</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/amendment-to-parent-company-financial-results-group-results-unchanged/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited (NZOG) has identified a misstatement in the Parent company results released on Tuesday, 26th August 2014. There is no impact on the NZOG Group consolidated results for the year, which remain unchanged from that previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary full year results announcement contained the audited consolidated financial statements, which included the Parent company accounts. It has been subsequently identified that intercompany dividend distributions from two wholly owned subsidiaries were overstated by $11.6 million, which in turn overstated the finance income, profit after tax and advances to related parties of the Parent.

			<title>Chairman &amp; CEO Address at Auckland Investor Briefing 2014</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/chairman-and-ceo-address-at-auckland-investor-briefing-2014/</link>
			<description>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auckland Investor Briefing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great Northern Room, Ellerslie Auckland Racing Club, 80 Ascot Ave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 Noon Tuesday, 26 August 2014.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chairman’s Address&lt;br&gt;Peter Griffiths, Chairman, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Auckland Investor Briefing represents a departure from our practice in the past. Previously we have always held the briefing on the same day as the Annual General Meeting in Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this morning we released our Annual Results for the financial year just completed. It seems appropriate to discuss your company’s performance and our strategies while the data is fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategic decision that underlies everything we do is that our role as a company is to be New Zealand’s oil and gas explorers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes us New Zealand? There’s our name, the location of our head office, our ownership by 14,000 New Zealanders. But what really being a New Zealand company means is our set of New Zealand values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to be seen as a dependable, capable and sought-after partner, both for commercial partners and for the communities where we work. The way we achieve that in practice is to work with integrity, being open, transparent and constructive, and seeking relationships that are mutually beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This strategy gives us a unique position in the marketplace - the company that commercial partners want on their team and the partner that communities welcome and trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year our role in the New Zealand exploration sector resulted in Woodside’s decision to partner with us for a New Zealand country-entry. That was a vote of confidence by a very large and significant player. It provides us with the opportunity to participate in the exciting frontier stories that are bringing global majors to New Zealand. So it’s an example of how our strategy of being partner of choice allows us to build the strongest exploration portfolio we can, while maintaining a focus on the efficient operation of our asset base&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the strategy will need to achieve balance between further exploration and dividends that provide an immediate return to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board has made a decision to fix the dividend for the half year at 3 cents per share, maintaining the full year dividend at 6 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This return will allow us to maintain a targeted exploration spend in the coming year of around US$35 million&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to invest to grow shareholder value in future. The opportunities that come from partnering with a company like Woodside in deepwater prospects off Taranaki and in the Great South Basin are exciting - but they are also demanding. It takes considerable resource to explore in deepwater frontier plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We manage that by balancing the portfolio across geology, geography, markets, regulatory regimes, and maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our onshore successes in Kisaran are an example, where wells are cheaper to drill, with the other side of the coin being smaller target resources. A final investment decision at Kisaran is still to be made, but if it goes ahead, the production from there would add a new strand of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can continue to pursue our strategic options because of the strong operating cash-flow we have achieved in our producing fields this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of achievements stand out for special mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have announced today that the cost of purchasing a greater share of Tui has already been recovered. This is remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tui is a declining asset, and even with our extra share of it, returns from the field are lower than last year’s. Next year we will have production from Pateke to boost Tui production some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from Kupe was also up, with contributions from accelerated gas sales and from the settlement of negotiations around over-riding royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all added up to strong operating cash flows that will fund further growth, allows us to maintain a dividend this year, and preserves the balance sheet strength for future growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sound story that I am proud to commend to you as shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would now like to invite Andrew Knight to discuss more of the specifics of this year’s result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CEO’s Address&lt;br&gt;Andrew Knight, Chief Executive, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operational performance over the last year has been excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is reflected in the strong production and operating cash-flow results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cash-flow from operations result, year on year, is very strong: Up by 62 per cent from about 54 million to 88 million dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary driver of that was our success in getting more value out of our existing assets. Kupe production was steady throughout the year. One reason for increased performance was that there was a maintenance shut-in at Kupe in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the steady production this year, gas sales contracts have been accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales from Tui would have declined much more this year as the reserves in the field deplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in fact Tui performance has been another part of our success story after we increased our share of the Tui fields from 12.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent by buying some of Mitsui’s interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, revenue for the year was up by 4.7 per cent, from $99 million to $104 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major contributors to that revenue were production from Tui and Kupe, offset by some foreign exchange losses caused by the strength of the New Zealand dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a positive impact of just over ten million dollars from the settlement of the Kupe overriding royalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of Kupe — and of the overriding royalty - is a diverting story with a few lessons for us today about successful exploration, and the timelines involved in recovering revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’d like to take a minute to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe-1 was first drilled in 1975 by Shell, BP and Todd. They had some hydrocarbon shows, but Kupe-1 was assessed as sub-commercial and plugged and abandoned, and the licence was handed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1981 New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas started up, won the prospecting licence over Kupe and listed on the stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company farmed out a share in the Kupe prospect to the state owned oil company,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrocorp. It’s illuminating to see that the seismic surveys conducted back then indicated oil and gas reserves that were about ten per cent the size of the currently proven reserves. Anyway, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas as operator drilled Kupe in 1986 and had a discovery. Other companies bought an interest in return for promise to pay an extra share of future production. In the midst of all this there were corporate restructurings and reorganisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Petrocorp was sold to Fletcher Challenge, which was also later broken up and sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result of it all was that two of the current partners in Kupe, Origin and Genesis, had an obligation to pay an extra share to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas - called an over-riding royalty. Origin’s obligation relates to 10 per cent of its 50 per cent share in Kupe; The Genesis obligation relates to 20 per cent of its 31 per cent share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year we were able to agree a settlement with Genesis, and talks with Origin are at a sufficiently advanced stage that we have included the anticipated settlement in this year’s accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is worth around $10 million and it will add about a further $1-2 million a year to the company’s revenue in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back over the Kupe story we can see some familiar patterns. It took a long time from when they first started exploring in Kupe in the early seventies, to first production in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a long time from the agreement to pay an overriding royalty to its impact in our financial statements today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also see that exploration is an uncertain business. Initial failure was followed by persistence, and persistence produced success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe is a fantastic asset for us, and it will continue to produce for many years. Only the gas and light oil prospects in the permit are producing, but we are still looking in the permit for oil&lt;br&gt;as well as further gas and gas condensate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the founders of New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas knew was that you can’t give up at the first set back. You have to keep investing in exploration to succeed. Kupe would not have become the valuable producing asset it is today without investment patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why, in the past year, we have recorded a high level of investment in exploration and evaluation - up 77 per cent from the previous year, to just under $75 million, and up from $9 million in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration investment has had an impact on net profit, but we have been able to sustain the dividend even while we accessed the opportunities that exploration can bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration is an exercise in balancing investment risk. If we don’t take risks we can’t replace and grow our reserves and asset base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two exploration successes during the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pateke-4H well will by tied back to the Tui FPSO and it will increase production from the Tui fields from next year. We are still working on the size of the reservoir there. Engineers are modelling the porosity of the rock (that is, how fast the oil flows from it) and the pressure they are getting (which gives them idea of the size of the resource.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture hasn’t come to a shared view yet. Our own calculations are consistent with the operator’s public, pre-drill estimates of around 2.5 million barrels of oil, or somewhere between 650,000 and 700,000 barrels net to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had drilling success at Kisaran, in Indonesia. The plan of development has been drafted there and it’s being worked through with the regulator. In a production sharing contract, the joint venture gets 85 per cent of the revenue from the field until it has been able to recover its development costs (and a margin). After that it receives 15 per cent of the production profits. So you can see that the regulator has a strong interest in the cost of development, and it has to be worked through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a final investment decision is made later this year, production will begin next year. It would involve a series of low cost wells each accessing a modest resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been strengthening our position in Indonesia because it offers opportunities that are complementary to our New Zealand portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The onshore prospects are lower cost to access, although they are often smaller targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are similar in many ways to onshore Taranaki opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesia opportunity-set compliments the extension of our New Zealand portfolio into deepwater permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Griffiths spoke earlier about our ability to attract Woodside as a partner. When other global majors look at New Zealand, they are seeing an attractive prospect in our frontier basins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell and Statoil are looking off the north west of the North Island and out towards New Caledonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woodside is with us in deepwater off Taranaki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko is in Pegasus east of Wellington. They drilled outside our permits off South Canterbury last summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are joining Woodside in the Great South Basin; and Shell is intending to drill there too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest in New Zealand’s frontier basins is elevated. It’s a matter of time before someone has some success. I want us to be positioned to be part of success when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But operating in deepwater frontier basins requires considerable expertise and careful management of our portfolio to ensure we don’t get over-exposed. We need to invest enough to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also need to be able to add value to our partners in these frontier basins. We are always looking for further opportunities to grow our production - as we did when we bought more production at Tui.If we find further opportunities to buy assets at value, and they fit our portfolio, we will need to take them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this review illustrates three key components in our strategy to grow shareholder value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- First, looking to optimise current assets. We have been successful this year in getting more value out of both Kupe and Tui. There is more to do in Kupe, in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Second, we need to keep exploring across a range of geological, jurisdictional and investment risk-types. Our portfolio in Taranaki is looking full, and we have exposure in frontier basins in New Zealand. In Indonesia we have a portfolio of assets at a range of stages in the pipeline, including appraisal, seismic underway, and early stage evaluation. As different prospects get churned out of the portfolio we will look to add new exploration acreage in places where our New Zealand identity and values can provide a strategic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Third, we intend to be open to new opportunities to extend the asset base where there is value to be extracted. In the Kupe gas contracts and in our Tui extension we have proved we can be successful at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we are well-positioned, with a strong balance sheet, and a value set that allows communities and commercial partners to want to work with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year will be about leveraging these advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use our strong cash generation capability and our enduring community partnerships to deliver growth through exploration investment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Tui Reserves</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/tui-reserves/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The operator of the Tui oil fields in Petroleum Mining Permit 38158, offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, has this afternoon published updated figures for its Tui reserves as part of its normal market reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated in our earlier announcement, the Tui joint venture has not agreed an updated view following the Pateke-4H well this year. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas believes Tui reserves are consistent with those estimated prior to drilling Pateke-4H, including reserves from Pateke- 4H of around 2.5 million barrels of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resource information was estimated using a deterministic methodology. This report is based on information compiled by Andrew Jefferies, Vice President of Operations and Engineering at New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas. Mr Jefferies is a Society of Petroleum Engineers Certified Petroleum Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View &amp;amp; Download Documents: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/NZOG-2014-Financial-Statements-for-release.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 Financial Statements&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/NZOG-2014-Final-Dividend-for-release.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 Final Dividend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas annual accounts show revenue for the financial year ended 30 June 2014 was up 4.7 percent to NZ$104 million, reflecting a strong operating performance from the company’s key assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cashflows from operations were up 62 per cent to $88 million for the financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and exploration expenses (EBITDAX) were up 12.4 per cent to NZ$76 million from NZ$68 million last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net profit after tax was NZ$10.1 million for the 2013-14 year, down from NZ$26 million last year mainly because of a sharp increase in exploration expenses and some FX losses on USD cash holdings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will pay a final unimputed dividend of 3 cents per share, bringing the total for the year to 6 cents per share. The final 3 cents per share dividend will be paid on 26 September to shareholders on record at 12 September 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Andrew Knight said, “Operational performance over the last year has been excellent and this is reflected in the strong production and operating cashflow results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production was up 26 per cent on a barrel of oil equivalent basis as a result of a return to full production at Kupe following a planned maintenance outage last year, and the company taking a larger stake in the producing Tui asset. The company’s share of the Tui asset from 12.5 percent to 27.5 percent effective from 1 October 2013. The cost of the acquisition has already been recovered from additional production and associated net operating earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further commercial success was achieved through the settlement of negotiations with Genesis Energy regarding overriding royalty revenue from Kupe. This delivered an additional NZ$7 million revenue for the year. The settlement relates to 20 per cent of Genesis Energy’s 31 per cent interest in the Kupe asset. Negotiations with Origin Energy (relating to 10 per cent out of its 50 per cent equity share) have reached an advanced stage, resulting in the recognition of additional revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year the company made a significant investment in exploration and evaluation with an active programme of drilling and seismic surveys. Exploration and evaluation investment was up 77 per cent, to NZ$75 million, compared to NZ$42 million the previous year. Looking forward, exploration expenditure is expected to be around US$35 million per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two successful wells were drilled during the year at Pateke-4H and Kisaran in Sumatra, Indonesia, adding to the future production profile for the company. A further two wells were plugged and abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pateke-4H well intersected an oil-bearing reservoir adjacent to existing operations at the Tui field. Pateke-4H has been suspended and planning is underway to install subsea infrastructure and a tie-line back to the Tui FPSO, Umuroa, with production expected in the current financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New seismic surveys were completed in the Clipper and Galleon permits in the Canterbury Basin, in the Waru and Matuku permits off Taranaki, and one commenced at Bohorok in Sumatra, Indonesia. Processing and interpretation of the resulting seismic data will continue into 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plan of development is being finalised for the Kisaran wells in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia, with a final investment decision expected before the end of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High grading of the exploration portfolio continued with the acquisition of four new permits during the year, two in deep water through the New Zealand 2013 Block Offer and a further two in Indonesia. Permits were relinquished during the year at Kanuka, Kakapo, onshore Manaia and Diodore in Tunisia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is pleasing to see our commitment to New Zealand values along with our knowledge and experience in the local petroleum industry is attracting partners such as Woodside,” Andrew Knight said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The company will continue to use its strong cash generation capability and enduring community partnerships to deliver growth through exploration investment while delivering value to shareholders”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/oi-weekly-update-15-july-2014/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Operations this morning are continuing to plug and abandon the Oi-2 well in Petroleum Mining Permit 38158, offshore Taranaki, New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next operation will be to abandon Oi-1 prior to releasing the rig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well intersected the primary target Kapuni F10 sands and underlying secondary targets last week. No significant oil shows were encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture partners in the Oi exploration well are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWE Limited: 31.25% (Operator).&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum: 50%&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (through subsidiary): 18.75%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Joint Venture partners in PMP 38158 are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWE Limited (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (via subsidiaries) 27.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15%&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>New unconventional interest in Indonesia</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-unconventional-interest-in-indonesia/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The right to explore for &#039;unconventional&#039; oil and gas resources in Central Sumatra, Indonesia, has been awarded to a consortium in which New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas holds an 11.25 per cent interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Sumatra is one of the major oil producing basins in South East Asia. The MNK Kisaran production sharing contract covers a substantial sub-basin in the same area as the conventional Kisaran production sharing contract where the consortium partners last year successfully drilled for oil and gas. A plan of development for that discovery is currently being prepared, and is expected later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MNK Kisaran production sharing contract has been formally initialled today. It is one of the first PSCs for unconventional oil and gas resources issued in Indonesia. It is the first time New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has had exposure to prospective oil and gas resources that qualify for concessional Indonesia government terms. Without those concessions the resources could not be developed commercially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconventional resources are those where substantial volumes of oil and gas are believed to be trapped in rocks, but the rate of production is severely limited by low permeability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial development of some of these types of rock has been made possible by new extraction technology, particularly in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consortium will study the effective application of these technologies in onshore Sumatra over the next three years. The first firm, three-year exploration work commitment includes geological and geophysical studies in each year and drilling a vertical exploration well in year three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MNK Kisaran partners are:&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas: 11.25%&lt;br&gt;Bukit Energy 33.75%&lt;br&gt;Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas 55%&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Oi-2 reaches total depth</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/oi-2-reaches-total-depth/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Oi-2 well in Petroleum Mining Permit 38158, offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, reached a total depth of 3,908 metres at 8.45 last night, the operator has advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well intersected the primary target Kapuni F10 sands and underlying secondary targets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No significant oil shows were encountered and real time well data indicated that the reservoir is water bearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operations began last night to retrieve the bottom hole assembly. At 6.00AM the bottom hole assembly was at 3,450 metres and continuing to be pulled out of the hole. The next operation will be to plug and abandon the well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas participated in the Oi well at reduced equity, and before drilling assessed the geological chance of success at 17 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oi is about 37 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in about 120 metres of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture partners in the Oi exploration well are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited: 31.25% (Operator).&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum: 50%&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (through subsidiary): 18.75%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Joint Venture partners in PMP 38158 are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (via subsidiaries) 27.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15%&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Agreement reached on Kupe overriding royalty</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/agreement-reached-on-kupe-overriding-royalty/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Agreement has been reached between New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas and Genesis Energy over the payment of overriding royalties from the Kupe oil and gas field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement will increase New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas net profit after tax for the 2013-14 financial year by $5 million. The impact in the 2013-14 financial year will reflect payments relating to that financial year as well as for prior years. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas expects its future revenue from Kupe will increase by $1-2 million each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overriding royalty has been under negotiation for several years. Negotiations are continuing with another Kupe partner, Origin Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The royalty arrangements originate from a series of transactions in the 1980s, when National Petroleum acquired an 89 per cent interest in what was then a prospecting licence in Kupe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the acquisition, National Petroleum agreed to pay overriding royalties to the parties it acquired its interest from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex corporate reorganisations and transfers since have affected those arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect is that an overriding royalty is payable to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas for petroleum produced from the Kupe licence area. The calculation of the value payable has been the subject of negotiation, which has been disclosed in financial accounts for recent years as a contingent asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is pleased to conclude negotiations with Genesis Energy on mutually satisfactory terms,&quot; New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas chief executive Andrew Knight says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Oi-2 progress report 1 July 2014</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/oi-2-progress-report-1-july-2014/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At 6.00AM today the Oi-2 well in Petroleum Mining Permit 38158, offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, was at a measured depth of 1,505 metres, the operator has advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 9 5/8 inch casing string has been installed and cemented at a depth of 1,487 metres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparations are underway to commence drilling ahead to the primary objective, the F10 sandstones anticipated at 3,690 metres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well costs have been adversely impacted by winter weather conditions in the offshore Taranaki Basin. The total cost of the Oi-1 and Oi-2 wells is now estimated at US$50.9 million (New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas share US$9.54 million), which includes a contingent provision for weather downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oi is about 37 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in about 120 metres of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture partners in the Oi exploration well are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited: 31.25% (Operator).&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum: 50%&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (through subsidiary): 18.75%.&lt;/p&gt;

			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/oi-2-spuds/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Drilling is underway in the Oi-2 well in Petroleum Mining Permit 38158, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drilling operations began at 5.30 this morning New Zealand time. The current operation is drilling ahead with a 36 inch drill to 228 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oi is about 37 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in about 120 metres of water. The well is a replacement for Oi-1, which was abandoned after encountering difficulties in the well bore at 1,507 metres. Oi-2 targets the same prospect and will be drilled to a planned total depth of 3,881 metres (below rotary table).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator has publicly stated a pre-drill un-risked best estimate prospective resource of 11 million barrels of recoverable oil. The New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas share at drilled equity of 18.75 per cent is 2.06 million barrels, with the option to restore to 27.5 per cent equity (3 million barrels) in exchange for reimbursement of pro-rata costs and a buy back premium. A further joint venture partner, Pan Pacific Petroleum, has publicly released its own estimates of the prospective resource. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas considers the well has a 17 per cent geological chance of success, and a 16 per cent chance of commercial development. The drilling programme is now planned to total around 48 days at a cost to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas estimated to be around USD8.34 million (updated figure).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resources in this statement have been evaluated using a probabilistic methodology. The estimate of prospective resources referred to in this statement is based on, and fairly represents, information and supporting documentation prepared by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Vice President of Operations and Engineering Andrew Jefferies (B Eng Mech Hons, Msc Pet Eng, MBA), a Society of Petroleum Engineers Certified Petroleum Engineer who has over 23 years of industry experience, and reflects and summarises the most current information supplied by the joint venture operator. The estimated quantities of petroleum that may potentially be recovered by the application of a future development project relate to undiscovered accumulations. These estimates have both an associated risk of discovery and a risk of development. Further exploration appraisal and evaluation is required to determine the existence of a significant quantity of potentially moveable hydrocarbons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The joint venture partners in the Oi exploration well are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited: 31.25% (Operator).&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum: 50%&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (through subsidiary): 18.75%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/Oi-2-13062014.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>New well drilled at Oi</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-well-drilled-at-oi/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A new well will be drilled in the Oi prospect in Petroleum Mining Permit 38158 after encountering difficulties setting casing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oi-1 had drilled a 17 ½ inch hole to a depth of 1,507 metres when operational difficulties were encountered setting casing. Attempts to install cement plugs and sidetrack the well were also unsuccessful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The joint venture has decided to seal Oi-1 and abandon it, drilling a new well, Oi-2, nearby.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To improve conditions in Oi-2, 13 3/8 inch casing will be set at 550 metres rather than 1,500 metres planned in Oi-1. This will enable a drilling fluids system to be established at a shallow depth and improve management of conditions in the well bore. Then a 12 ¼ hole will be drilled to 1,500 metres before 9 5/8 inch casing is set. An 8 ½ inch hole will then be drilled to the target depth of 3,881 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The drilling programme is now planned to take up to 48 days at a cost of around USD40 million ($7.5 million to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oi is about 37 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand in about 120 metres of water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator has publicly stated a pre-drill un-risked best estimate prospective resource of 11 million barrels of recoverable oil.

			<title>Oi well spuds in Tui permit</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/oi-well-spuds-in-tui-permit/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Kan Tan IV semi-submersible drilling rig began drilling the Oi-1 exploration well in Petroleum Mining Permit 38158, approximately 37 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand at 6.30PM on Friday, 30 May (NZDT).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 6.00AM this morning a 17.5 inch hole had been drilled to a depth of 510 metres, and 30 inch casing had been run and cemented to 229 metres. The current operation was drilling ahead to 1500 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oi-1 is a vertical well in water depth of about 120 metres. It is expected to take around 30 days to drill to a planned total measured depth of 3,881 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator has publicly stated a pre-drill un-risked best estimate prospective resource of 11 million barrels of recoverable oil. The New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas share at drilled equity of 18.75 per cent is 2.06 million barrels, with the option to restore to 27.5 per cent equity (3 million barrels) in exchange for reimbursement of pro-rata costs and a buy back premium. A further joint venture partner, Pan Pacific Petroleum, has publicly released its own estimates of the prospective resource.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator estimates gross drilling costs of USD27 million (New Zealand Oil and Gas share USD5 million). New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas considers the well has a 17 per cent geological chance of success, and a 16 per cent chance of commercial development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the results of the Oi-1 exploration well indicate the presence of a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir, the joint venture may decide to drill a sidetrack hole to provide additional information to assist with the determination of resources and viability for any future development. A sidetrack would be drilled on a full equity share basis (i.e. 27.5% to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas). It is expected that a commercial discovery would later be tied back to the Tui production facility, the FPSO Umuroa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resources in this statement have been evaluated using a probabilistic methodology. The estimate of prospective resources referred to in this statement is based on, and fairly represents, information and supporting documentation prepared by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Vice President of Operations and Engineering Andrew Jefferies (B Eng Mech Hons, Msc Pet Eng, MBA), a Society of Petroleum Engineers Certified Petroleum Engineer who has over 23 years of industry experience, and reflects and summarises the most current information supplied by the joint venture operator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The estimated quantities of petroleum that may potentially be recovered by the application of a future development project relate to undiscovered accumulations. These estimates have both an associated risk of discovery and a risk of development. Further exploration appraisal and evaluation is required to determine the existence of a significant quantity of potentially moveable hydrocarbons.&lt;br&gt;BACKGROUND TO OI&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Oi well is northeast of the producing Tui area oil fields within the same Petroleum Mining Permit. Tui production currently comes from three distinct accumulations within the fields - Tui, Pateke, and Amokura. The Pateke-4H well this year confirmed further resources, and it will be tied back to Umuroa for production in 2015. If successful, Oi would be an expansion of the Tui fairway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The well objective is to evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of a 4-way dip closed structure similar to the producing Tui, Amokura and Pateke fields and it will target the same F10 reservoir sandstones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oi-1 is the next structure north of Tui with sufficient estimated potential size to contain commercial amounts of hydrocarbons. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas believes several possibilities exist for charge into the well, so the main uncertainty is whether Kapuni F10 reservoir sands are present. As the seismic signature over the Oi prospect is different to that over the producing Tui fields, the company believes there is uncertainty in the quality of the reservoir and whether it is present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE JOINT VENTURE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum increased its participation in the Oi exploration well to 50 per cent under the sole risk provisions of the Tui Joint Venture Operating Agreement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In October last year New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas increased its interest in the Tui fields from 12.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent when Tui joint venture partners purchased an interest in the field previously held by Mitsui. AWE and Mitsui had opted to participate in Oi at a reduced interest, so as a result of purchasing Mitsui’s interest both New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas and AWE will participate in the Oi well at equity levels lower than their equity in PMP38158. The partners have the option to restore their full equities in any development subject to reimbursement of pro-rata costs and payment of a buy-back premium. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has further exposure to Oi through its 15 per cent holding in Pan Pacific Petroleum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The joint venture partners in the Oi exploration well are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited: 31.25% (Operator).&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum: 50%&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (through subsidiary): 18.75%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The joint venture partners in PMP 38158 are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited: 57.5% (Operator).&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum: 15%&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (through subsidiary): 27.5%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;leftAlone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImage726513-Oi2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Oi2&quot; height=&quot;513&quot; width=&quot;726&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;leftAlone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImage731785-Oi1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Oi1&quot; height=&quot;785&quot; width=&quot;731&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/Oi-well-commences-20140602.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Pateke-4H Weekly Update 20 May</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-weekly-update-20-may/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Pateke-4H well in PEP 38158, offshore Taranaki, has been successfully completed and suspended for production at a later date, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Production from Pateke-4H is planned for the first half of 2015 following the installation and commissioning of a sub-sea flow-line and ancillary control equipment connecting the well to the Tui Field gathering system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This work is scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preparations are being made to relocate the Kan Tan IV semi-submersible drilling rig to the northeast of the Tui field to the Oi-1 exploration well location.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On current planning Oi-1 is expected to commence drilling during the last week of May. The operator will make a further announcement then. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas advises it’s aware the other joint venture partner, Pan Pacific Petroleum, has released its estimate of prospective resources at Oi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AWE and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas are participating in the Oi well at reduced equities of 31.25 per cent and 18.75 per cent respectively, with the option to restore their full equities in any development subject to their reimbursement of pro-rata costs and payment of a buy-back premium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/20052014-Pateke-4H-Weekly-Update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Pateke-4H Weekly Update 13 May</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-weekly-update-13-may/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Production tubing was being run at the Pateke-4H well, in PEP 38158 offshore Taranaki, the Operator has advised as of six o’clock this morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The well will then be suspended for later production and the rig relocated 12 kilometers to the Oi-1 exploration well in the same permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On current planning Oi-1 is still expected to spud during the last week of May.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The installation of a sub-sea flowline and ancillary control equipment to the Tui Field gathering system, which will enable Pateke-4H to be flowed to the Tui Field FPSO Umuroa, is scheduled for the first quarter in 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drilling in the well ceased at 4,772 metres, including a 749 metre horizontal section through the reservoir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/13052014-Pateke-4H-Weekly-Update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Pateke-4H drilling update 6 May</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-drilling-update-6-may/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At 06:00 this morning (NZST) the Pateke-4H well offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, was at a total measured depth of 4,772 metres, including a 749 metre horizontal section through the reservoir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The total depth was revised from the original 5,381 metre target due to the high quality of the reservoir encountered and to ensure a stable well bore was achieved for effective completion and production.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Installation of a 6 5/8 inch slotted production liner has been completed and operations are currently setting the liner hanger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preparations are being made to run the completion and suspend the well to enable production in the first quarter of 2015 following the installation of sub-sea flowline infrastructure and tie-back to the Tui FPSO, Umuroa. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These activities are expected to take about 10 days. The well will then be suspended and the rig will move to the Oi-1 location. On current planning Oi-1 is expected to spud during the last week of May.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The oil-bearing properties of the Kapuni F10 reservoir are positive. Further analysis is required to determine the expected recovery from Pateke-4H, but initial evaluation is consistent with the pre-drill 2C resource estimate of 2.5 million barrels (687,500 barrels net to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the significant additional work required to mitigate the mechanical difficulties and drill the two sidetracks, costs have increased beyond the pre-drilling estimate, and the total project cost to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas (including the costs of tie back) is currently expected to be in the range of US$40-46 million. This estimate will be updated when more certainty exists around subsea installation costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resources have been evaluated using a deterministic black oil simulation.

			<title>Pateke-4H drilling further update 5 May</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-drilling-further-update-5-may/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Installation of a 6 5/8 inch slotted production liner has been completed at the Pateke-4H well offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 11:00AM NZST the well had been drilled to a revised measured total depth of 4,772 metres, including a 749 metre horizontal section through the reservoir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pre-drill 2C resource estimates recoverable from Pateke-4H were 2.5 million barrels, (687,500 barrels net to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas). While further work is required to determine the expected recovery from Pateke-4H, initial evaluation suggests a result consistent with pre-drill estimates. Further details of resource estimates will be provided when the data has been fully analysed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The well will now be completed and suspended to enable production in Q1 2015, following the installation of sub-sea flowline infrastructure and tie-back to the Tui FPSO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Resources have been evaluated using a deterministic black oil simulation. This statement has been compiled by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Vice President of Operations and Engineering Andrew Jefferies B Eng (Mech Hons), Msc Pet.

			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-drilling-update-29-april-2014-/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At 6.00 this morning (NZST) the Pateke-4H well, offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, was at a measured depth of 4,700 metres and drilling ahead horizontally through the Kapuni F10 sandstone reservoir with an 8 1/2 inch drilling assembly, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reservoir was intersected at 4,023 metres and operations have drilled 677 metres through the F10 reservoir section with approximately 681 metres remaining to reach a planned total measured depth of 5,381 metres. After that, a 6 5/8 inch production liner will be installed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results to date are positive. Oil shows and real-time measurement logs are consistent with pre-drill estimates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The commercial significance of Pateke-4H will be determined once horizontal drilling is completed and the reservoir size and quality is fully assessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is targeting a mapped northern extension of the currently producing Pateke field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If successful, the well will be completed for subsequent tie-back to the Tui FPSO (“Umuroa”) for production in 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/29042014-Pateke-4H-update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Seismic survey completed at Waru</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/seismic-survey-completed-at-waru/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A seismic survey of around 540 kilometres of 2D data has been completed in the Waru permit, PEP 54857 off South Taranaki, where New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas holds a 100 per cent interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The survey will help New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas geoscientists better understand the geological structures within Waru and identify areas of prospectivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas reached an agreement with the operator of the Maui joint venture to include two lines of seismic over the Maui field in exchange for data from the Rura-1A well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results of the well will enhance knowledge of the permit area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Waru seismic survey was completed by the vessel Aquila Explorer, and finished under budget despite weather interruptions. The survey complied fully with the Code of Conduct for minimising acoustic disturbance to marine mammals from seismic survey operations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data will now be sent for processing, and analysis will follow to determine further exploration plans in the permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The completed seismic survey satisfies the obligation to perform a 2D survey over at least 400 kilometres before September this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Waru permit covers around 525 square kilometres. A map is attached. No wells have been drilled in this permit. The block lies within the source kitchen for the Maui and Maari oil and gas fields. Rights to explore in the Waru permit were awarded to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas in the New Zealand Government’s December 2012 Block Offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/22042014-Waru-seismic-completed.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-drilling-update-22-april-2014/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At 6.00 this morning (NZST) the Pateke-4H well, offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, was at a measured depth of 3,863 metres and drilling ahead at around 10 metres/hour with an 8 1/2 inch drilling assembly after successfully side-tracking from the 9 5/8 inch casing at 3,587 metres, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator expects to reach the top of the reservoir and begin drilling into new reservoir tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drilling will continue through the F10 reservoir section to a planned total measured depth of 5,381 metres, following which a 6 5/8 inch production liner will be installed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kapuni F10 sandstone objective has already been intersected as expected with oil shows and real time logging measurements indicating the likely presence of an oil bearing reservoir. The commercial significance of the oil shows will not be clear until the horizontal drilling is completed and the reservoir size and quality is fully assessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is targeting a mapped northern extension of the currently producing Pateke field. If successful, the well will be completed for subsequent tie-back to the Tui FPSO (“Umuroa”) for production in 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/22042014-Pateke-4H-update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-drilling-update-15-april-2014/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;At 6.00 this morning (NZST) preparations were being made to drill a second sidetrack well at Pateke-4H, offshore Taranaki, New Zealand, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Operations have been unable to drill past an obstruction in the lower portion of the first sidetrack. A second sidetrack will be drilled from a measured depth of 3,587 metres with an 8 1/2 inch drilling assembly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The forward work plan requires the second sidetrack well to be drilled to a depth of approximately 4,110 metres and intersect the F10 reservoir horizontally. Drilling will continue through the F10 reservoir section to a planned total measured depth of 5,361 metres, and then a 6 5/8 inch production liner will be installed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kapuni F10 sandstone objective has already been intersected as expected with oil shows and real time logging measurements indicating the likely presence of an oil bearing reservoir. The commercial significance of the oil shows will not be clear until the horizontal drilling is completed and the reservoir size and quality is fully assessed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the additional work required to mitigate the operational difficulties encountered to date, pre-completion well costs have increased beyond the pre-spud estimate. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas now expects its share to exceed US$25 million. An updated estimate of well costs will be released after horizontal drilling is completed and the production liner has been installed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is targeting a mapped northern extension of the currently producing Pateke field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If successful, the well will be completed for subsequent tie-back to the Tui FPSO (“Umuroa”) for production in 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/15042014-Pateke-4H-update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;At 06:00 this morning (NZDT) the Pateke-4H development well sidetrack was at a measured depth of 3,845 metres and directionally drilling ahead with a 12 ¼ inch drilling assembly, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is planned to drill this section of the well to a measured depth of approximately 4,110 metres, landing at an angle of approximately 90 degrees, and then install the 9 5/8 inch casing. The well will then be drilled horizontally through the F10 reservoir to a planned measured depth of 5,361 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kapuni F10 sandstone objective has already been intersected as expected with oil shows and real time logging measurements indicating the likely presence of an oil bearing reservoir. The operator describes this as “very encouraging”, however, the commercial significance of the oil shows will not be clear until the horizontal drilling has been completed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is a northern extension of the existing Pateke reservoir in the producing Tui area oil fields in PMP 38158, approximately 50 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in water depth of about 124 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/25032014-Pateke-4H-update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Pateke-4H Drilling Update 18 March</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-drilling-update-18-march/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The operator of the Pateke-4H well in the Tui oil fields offshore Taranaki was preparing to sidetrack a short section of lower wellbore at 6.00 this morning NZDT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mechanical drill string difficulties experienced in the original hole, and advised last week, were unable to be fully resolved. The lower part of the hole has been abandoned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is now proposed to sidetrack with a 12 ¼ inch drilling assembly from a measured depth of 3,375 metres, drill into the F10 reservoir at a horizontal angle of approximately 90 degrees, and then set the 9 5/8 inch casing at approximately 4,110 metres as planned.&lt;br&gt;The well will then be drilled horizontally through the F10 reservoir to a total measured depth of 5,361 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kapuni F10 sandstone objective has already been intersected as expected with oil shows and real time logging measurements indicating the likely presence of an oil bearing reservoir. The operator describes this as “very encouraging”, however the commercial significance of the oil shows will not be clear until the horizontal drilling has been completed.&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is a northern extension of the existing Pateke reservoir in the producing Tui area oil fields in PMP 38158, approximately 50 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in water depth of about 124 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Additional Kupe field development opportunities</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/additional-kupe-field-development-opportunities/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas advises that an estimate has been published relating to contingent and prospective resources that may be available from additional development within the Kupe field in Petroleum Mining Licence 38146, located in offshore Taranaki, New Zealand. Gaffney Cline &amp;amp; Associates were commissioned as part of the Genesis Energy IPO process to undertake an independent expert assessment of the reserves, and contingent and prospective resources, within the producing Kupe field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment has been made public and relevant information is available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.genesisenergyshares.govt.nz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.genesisenergyshares.govt.nz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures released as part of the Genesis Energy IPO process reflect the independent analysis. As advised in the release of the New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas half-year result on 19 February, extracting more value from existing producing assets is a focus for New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas’s growth this year. Work is underway to assess prospects for recovery of additional resources from Kupe. This work is still at a conceptual stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas continues to work with the Kupe field operator and other JV partners to assess the potential for additional development opportunities. This work is expected to take around 12 months..&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 15 per cent interest in the Kupe field. Genesis Energy has a 31 per cent share (through subsidiaries).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other partners in the field are Origin Energy (50 per cent, Operator), and Mitsui E&amp;amp;P Australia Pty (4 per cent). The Kupe field is about 30 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki in around 35 metres of water. Production from the field began in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Pateke-4H drilling update 11 March 2014</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-drilling-update-11-march-2014/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The operator of the Pateke-4H well in the Tui oil fields offshore Taranaki has provided an update on drilling progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 06:00AM NZDT today the well had been drilled to a total measured depth of 4,110 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the penetration last week of the Kupuni F sand, where oil shows and real time logging measurements indicated the likely presence of an oil bearing reservoir, removal of the 12 ¼ inch drilling assembly has experienced mechanical drill string difficulties, which are currently being addressed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If remedial actions are unsuccessful, a short section of the well may need to be redrilled as a sidetrack operation. The development program then allows for the installation of the 9 5/8 inch casing, after which drilling will continue in the new hole, through the reservoir section, to a projected total measured depth of 5,361 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is a northern extension of the existing Pateke reservoir in the producing Tui area oil fields in PMP 38158, approximately 50 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in water depth of about 124 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/11032014-Pateke-4H-update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Reservoir encountered at Pateke-4H</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/reservoir-encountered-at-pateke-4h/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Pateke-4H well had been drilled to a total measured depth of 4,110 metres at 6.00 this morning NZDT and encountered the primary objective Kapuni F sands, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oil shows have been observed by surface monitoring equipment and realtime petrophysical measurements indicate the likely presence of an oil-bearing reservoir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9 5/8 inch casing will now be run and cemented to a measured depth of 4100 metres, then drilling will continue through the reservoir section. At a projected total measured depth of 5,361 metres sufficient data will be available to determine whether the reservoir is commercial. A decision will then be made whether to complete the well and subsequently tie it back to the Tui FPSO “Umuroa”, in which case production would be expected in 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The theory behind the Pateke-4H well is that an accumulation of oil in a northern extension is not being recovered by the producing Pateke well. Pateke is one of three producing fields in the Tui area oil fields in PMP 38158, approximately 50 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand. Pateke-4H is in water depth of about 124 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drilling began on 9 February. The objective of the well was to test whether the reservoir sands exist where expected, and if so, whether the reservoir has been emptied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Pateke-4H drilling update 4 March</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-drilling-update-4-march/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The operator of the Pateke-4H well in the Tui oil fields offshore Taranaki has advised that the well was at a measured depth of 3689 metres at 6.00AM NZDT today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blow Out Preventer (BOP) was successfully installed and tested and the 13 3/8 inch casing shoe was drilled out. A 12 ¼ inch section was drilled vertically to 3,000 metres, at which point directional drilling commenced at an inclination of 45 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12 ¼ inch section is planned to be drilled to a TD of 4,100 metres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pateke-4H is a northern extension of the existing Pateke reservoir in the producing Tui area oil fields in PMP 38158, approximately 50 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in water depth of about 124 metres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling began on 10 February. The well is expected to take around two months to drill to a planned total measured depth of 5,361 metres, including a 1,271 metre horizontal section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the event that commercial volumes are discovered the well will be completed and later tied into the existing Tui production facilities. Production of first oil would be in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has 27.5 per cent interest in Tui.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other Tui joint venture partners are:&lt;br&gt;AWE Limited (via subsidiaries) (Operator) 57.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum (via subsidiaries) 15.0%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Half Year Result 19 Feb 2014</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/half-year-result/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;• Gross profit steady&lt;br&gt;• EBITDAX up 13% &lt;br&gt;• Growth through increased Tui stake and Woodside partnership&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas will pay shareholders an unimputed interim dividend of 3 cents per share on 4 April 2014. The company today announced an operating performance in line with expectations for the six months to 31 December 2013. Gross profit for the half year was $26.713 million compared to $26.616 million in the first half of the 2012-13 financial year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBITDAX (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exploration expenses) increased 13 per cent to $31.414 million for the half-year, up from $27.868 million in the comparable previous period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue increased by 7 per cent to $51.419 million from $47.869 million in the same period mainly as a result of a full period of production and sales after the maintenance shutdown at Kupe last year. Total production increased 20 per cent to 0.6 million barrels of oil equivalent, (MMBOE) up from 0.5 MMBOE. Net operating cash-flow of $52.274 million rose from $25.233 million in the comparable previous half-year mainly due to timing of receipts for oil shipments in June, lower taxes and royalties, and insurance proceeds related to the Kupe asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase of an increased share of production from the Tui oil fields in Taranaki, at a cost of cost $7.733 million, led to slightly higher sales revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating costs were $24.706 million compared to $21.253 million in the comparable previous half-year. Operating costs excluding amortisation were up 8 per cent to $11.334 million from $10.454 million, while amortisation grew to $13.372 million from $10.799 million in the same period last year due mainly to last year’s maintenance shutdown at Kupe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had no debt and $164.211 million of cash at 31 December 2013, compared to $170.997 in cash 12 months previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net profit after tax was $4.003 million, including an unrealised foreign exchange loss of $2.4 million pre-tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXPLORATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on exploration and evaluation was up significantly, to $23.747 million from $10.526 million, as New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas expanded its portfolio and was involved in more exploration activity compared to the previous period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GROWTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has a very strong balance sheet and is able to use it to pursue three avenues to grow returns for shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Building out the portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three new offshore permits were awarded in the 2013 New Zealand Block Offer. In the Vulcan permit off Taranaki, and Toroa in the Canterbury-Great South Basin, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas partnered with Woodside, a significant step in the company’s strategy of being the partner of choice for exploration in New Zealand. Also in the Canterbury-Great South Basin the company was awarded the Galleon permit, adjacent to its existing Clipper interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two permits, Kakapo and Kanuka in offshore Taranaki, were surrendered. In late December a consortium in which the company has an interest was awarded a new production sharing contract, Palmerah Baru in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Ensuring we maximize value within existing exploration assets by developing new prospects within existing acreage.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the period New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas took over as operator in the Clipper permit in the Canterbury-Great South Basin and conducted a successful 650 square kilometre seismic survey in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company participated in drilling the Matuku well. Meanwhile analysis has begun on the results of two wells in Indonesia, which produced oil and gas shows during drilling in the Kisaran production sharing contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Adding value to existing producing assets by ensuring they are fully developed and all opportunities are explored.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas more than doubled its share of the producing Tui oil fields, from 12.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent, by acquiring a 15 per cent share from Mitsui E&amp;amp;P Australia Pty Limited. Cash returns are expected to repay this investment within a short period. The company is currently participating in drilling in the Pateke-4H well in the Tui fields, which will be immediately followed by the Oi well (at a reduced equity level of 18.75 per cent with the option to restore full equity in any development subject to reimbursement of pro-rata costs and payment of a buy back premium.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has begun to assess opportunities for further development of resources within the producing Kupe asset. Prospects for further recovery in Kupe are still at a conceptual stage, and we expect they will be developed further over the next 12 months as resource size and commercial potential are analysed and tested.&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Pateke-4H well in the Tui oil fields offshore Taranaki was at a measured depth of 1507 metres at 6.00AM NZDT today, the operator has advised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;13 3/8 inch casing is being run. The next operation will be to cement the casing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pateke-4H is a northern extension of the existing Pateke reservoir in the producing Tui area oil fields in PMP 38158, approximately 50 kilometres off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in water depth of about 124 metres.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Pateke-4H begins drilling</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/pateke-4h-begins-drilling/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Kan Tan IV semi-submersible drilling rig began drilling the Pateke-4H well in PMP 38158 at 10.45AM (New Zealand daylight time) yesterday, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 06:00AM today a 36” hole had been drilled to a depth of 234 metres. Preparations are being made to run and cement a 30” conductor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is a northern extension of the existing Pateke reservoir in the producing Tui area oil fields, approximately 50km off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in water depth of about 124 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is expected to take around two months to drill to a planned total measured depth of 5,361 metres, including a 1,271 metre horizontal section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator’s pre-drill estimate is of an un-risked 2C Contingent Resource of 2.5 million barrels for the joint venture, or 687,500 barrels net to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas. (The resource information was estimated using a deterministic methodology, based on the Pateke reservoir simulation model and the evaluation is current. This report is based on information compiled by Andrew Jefferies, Vice President of Operations and Engineering at New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas. Mr Jefferies is a Society of Petroleum Engineers Certified Petroleum Engineer.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the event that commercial volumes are discovered the well will be completed and later tied into the existing Tui production facilities. Production of first oil would be in the first half of 2015 or later In October last year New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas increased its interest in the field from 12.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent. The other Tui joint venture partners are: AWE Limited 57.5% (Operator); and Pan Pacific Petroleum 15%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BACKGROUND TO PATEKE-4H&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Pateke is one of three separate accumulations of oil developed in the Tui Area Oil Fields - Tui, Amokura and Pateke.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GEOLOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Tui oil accumulations are in Kapuni-F sandstones, deposited during the Paleocene epoch 66 to 56 million years ago in the &#039;Kapuni&#039; shoreface (shallow marine) fairway. The reservoir is at a depth of around 3,650 metres subsea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Organic-rich shales and coals of the Late Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago) and Paleocene are the likely sources of the oil. The oil may have orginated from a source kitchen deep within the Taranaki basin, possibly the East Maui Graben to the east of Tui. Vertical migration occurred through faults and fractures and then laterally via sandstone carrier beds, finally accumulating in Paleocene sandstone reservoirs within structural trap closures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The structural traps are low relief, dip-closed features. The reservoirs are clean, laterally extensive, high permeability marine sandstones, with the oil accumulations overlying strong aquifer drives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PATEKE-4H&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aim of the Pateke-4H well is to explore a northern extension of the Pateke lobe that geologists believe may not be fully exploited by the current producing well, Pateke-3H.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The theory being tested is that the reservoir in the Pateke structure is separated into two areas, and that Southern area was drained by the 3H well in the early stages of the Tui development, while the northern may not have been and is the target of the 4H well. (See diagram)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The well will be drilled horizontally because the reservoir is thought to be over 1000 metres wide but less than ten metres deep, which reduces the ability of a vertical well to recover efficiently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Uploads/Pateke-Spuds-1.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;leftAlone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImage600604-Pateke-Spuds-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pateke Spuds 2&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;604&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEVELOPMENT OF THE TUI OIL FIELDS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Tui-1 well, drilled in February 2003, encountered a 10 metre oil column in excellent quality reservoir. A marine seismic survey was carried out over 250 square kilometres in April 2003 to delineate the Tui field accumulation and other nearby structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on the 3D seismic mapping, further exploration wells were drilled on nearby structures similar to the Tui field during 2004. The Amokura-1 well was drilled in April 2004, and encountered a 12 metre oil column. The Pateke-2 well was drilled in August 2004 and also encountered a 12 metre oil column.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Production from the Tui fields began on 30 July 2007 and is expected to continue until around 2020. To date the field has produced over 30 million barrels of oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Tui development comprises four horizontally drilled and subsea completed wells. The extended horizontal production sections in the oil reservoirs range from 819 metres to 1,850 metres. Each is tied back to a leased Floating Production Storage and Offtake (FPSO) vessel, the Umuroa. In May 2008 an agreement was signed extending the charter of the Umuroa through to 2015, with one year rights of renewal until 2022.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Uploads/Pateke-Spuds-Image-2.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;leftAlone&quot; title=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/Uploads/_resampled/ResizedImage590417-Pateke-Spuds-Image-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pateke Spuds Image 2&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; height=&quot;417&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/10022014-Pateke-spuds-4.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kan Tan IV moves to Pateke-4H</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/kan-tan-iv-moves-to-pateke-4h/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Kan Tan IV semi-submersible drilling rig has finished its deployment in the Matuku prospect in PEP 51906 and been handed over to the Tui joint venture in PMP 38158.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is a northern extension of the existing Pateke reservoir in the producing Tui area oil fields, approximately 50km off the coast of Taranaki, New Zealand, in water depth of about 124 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator has advised that the rig was handed over this morning and is moving into position for drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Pateke-4H well will be drilled to a planned total measured depth of 5,361 metres, including a 1,271 metre horizontal section.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator estimates that, if the Pateke-4H well is successful, it could increase recovery from the Tui oil fields by approximately 2.5 million barrels of oil. If successful the well will be completed and later tied back to the existing Tui FPSO vessel, Umuroa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In October last year New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas more than doubled its interest in the field, from 12.5 per cent to 27.5 per cent. The other Tui joint venture partners are: AWE Limited 57.5% &lt;br&gt;(Operator); and Pan Pacific Petroleum 15%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; gas has an interest in each of Matuku and Pateke, but the joint ventures are different. Participants in the Matuku-1 well in PEP 51906 were OMV New Zealand (Operator) 65 per cent; Octanex 22.5 per cent; and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas 12.5 per cent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/05022014-Pateke-rig-handover.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/matuku-well-completed-kan-tan-iv-moves-to-pateke-4h-/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Matuku-1 well in PEP 51906 offshore Taranaki has been plugged, the operator has advised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The semi-submersible drilling rig, Kan Tan IV, will next move to the Pateke prospect in the Tui oil fields in PMP 38158.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drilling operations at Matuku began on 30 November and the well was drilled to 4,846 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As previously advised, the well did encounter expected sandstones in the primary and secondary targets (Kapuni Group F-sands and North Cape Formation) but commercial&lt;br&gt;volumes of oil and gas were not present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is a northern extension of the existing Pateke reservoir in the Tui fields that are already producing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H is expected to take around two months to drill to a depth of 3,655 metres. A separate advisory will be issued when drilling commences in the well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participants in PEP 51906 are OMV New Zealand (Operator) 65 per cent; Octanex 22.5 per cent; and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas 12.5 per cent. In Tui the partners are AWE , 57.5 per cent (operator); New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, 27.5 per cent; and Pan Pacific Petroleum, 15 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Matuku-1 News Release 20 Jan 14</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/matuku-1-news-release/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In PEP 51906, Matuku reaches total depth and new seismic completed Total depth of 4846 metres was reached on Saturday, 18 January in the Matuku well in PEP 51906 offshore Taranaki. The next operation is pulling out of the hole prior to running wireline logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kan Tan IV began drilling operations on Saturday, 30 November. Matuku-1 is in 130 meters of water. Meanwhile the 400 square kilometre ‘Kaka’ 3D seismic survey in the same permit was completed the same day, ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kaka survey began on 5 January using the survey vessel Polarcus Alima. The primary target in the Matuku well, Kapuni Group Farewell F Sands, were found to be porous but there were no significant gas or oil shows. Oil shows were seen in D Sands and North Cape Formation units deeper in the well. Geoscientists will now analyse these results to form a view about the play types around the Kahurangi Trough, which was thought to be a source kitchen for a success case at Matuku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kaka 3D survey will provide valuable information about the Paleocene Farewell and Eocene Mangahewa Formations. This dataset along with the Matuku well results should assist in understanding the source of the Tui, Maui and Maari fields neighbouring PEP 51906. Participants in PEP 51906 are OMV New Zealand (Operator) 65 per cent; Octanex 22.5 per cent; and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas 12.5 per cent. OMV New Zealand are paying 100% of the Matuku-1 well costs under the conditions of their farm in agreement with Octanex.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title> Matuku-1 progress report 14 Jan 2014</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/matuku-1-progress-report-14-jan-2014/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the weekly progress report was issued yesterday, the Matuku-1 well in PEP 51906 offshore Taranaki has drilled into the Kapuni Group Farewell F Sands at 3935 metres. The F sands were found to be porous, but there were no significant gas or oil shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well is continuing to drill ahead to a total depth of 4754 metres. Drilling will be followed by wireline logging. The Kan Tan IV began drilling operations on Saturday, 30 November. Matuku-1 is in 130 meters of water. Participants in PEP 51906 are OMV New Zealand (Operator) 65 per cent; Octanex 22.5 per cent; and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas 12.5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Matuku-1 is successful, either New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas or Octanex may exercise an option for New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas to acquire a further 5 per cent of Octanex’s share, which would equalise each company’s interest at 17.5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Matuku-1 update 16 Jan 14</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/matuku-1-update-16-jan-14/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas believes its share price has been affected by the previously released news that the primary target zone in the Matuku well in PEP 51906 offshore Taranaki has not encountered significant oil or gas shows. The well is currently at a depth of 4307 metres and drilling ahead to a total depth of 4750 metres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until driling is complete and testing analysed, geologists have not formed a complete view about the well or the implications for the play type in the Kahurangi trough, which was thought to be a source kitchen for a success case at Matuku. No new information has come to hand that materially adds to information released on Tuesday, 14 January, when the company confirmed that Kapuni Group Farewell F Sands were found to be porous, but there were no significant gas or oil shows. Chief Executive Andrew Knight says a negative result in any well is always much more likely than a positive result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most wells will not make commercial discoveries of oil and gas. Our company explores a portfolio of prospects in order to balance the investment risks around individual wells. In the near future, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is involved in drilling in the Tui permit at Pateke and Oi, and next summer in the Kaheru prospect off South Taranaki.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kan Tan IV began drilling operations on Saturday, 30 November. Matuku-1 is in 130 meters of water. Participants in PEP 51906 are OMV New Zealand (Operator) 65 per cent; Octanex 22.5 per cent; and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas 12.5 per cent. If Matuku-1 is successful, either New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas or Octanex may exercise an option for New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas to acquire a further 5 per cent of Octanex’s share, which would equalise each company’s interest at 17.5 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Matuku-1 weekly progress report January 13</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/matuku-1-weekly-progress-report-january-13/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The Matuku-1 well in PEP 51906 offshore Taranaki has been drilled to 3913 meters as of&lt;br&gt;6.00AM Sunday, 12 January 2014. A 9 5/8 inch casing string has been set to 3409 meters.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Clipper seismic survey completed </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/31-december-2013/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has completed an incident-free 3D seismic survey covering&lt;br&gt;approximately 650 square kilometres of the Clipper permit East of Oamaru.&lt;br&gt;The seismic vessel Polarcus Alima began the survey on 17 December towing twelve seismic&lt;br&gt;streamers, each 100 metres apart and reaching eight kilometres behind the vessel. The&lt;br&gt;survey was completed at approximately 8.30 this morning, more than a week ahead of&lt;br&gt;schedule. The terms of the Clipper exploration permit required a 3D survey to be completed&lt;br&gt;by October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The survey included an extension into the Galleon permit immediately southwest of Clipper.&lt;br&gt;Rights to explore in the Galleon permit were awarded to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas in the New&lt;br&gt;Zealand Government 2013 Block Offer on 6 December. The completed seismic survey&lt;br&gt;extension satisfies New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas’s first year work obligation for this permit.&lt;br&gt;(Details of the Block Offer award are at &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/k4T1B7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/k4T1B7&lt;/a&gt; .)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data from the survey will be processed overseas and then analysed by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;Gas geoscientists in Wellington. The next process of study could take one to two years.&lt;br&gt;The Clipper and Galleon permits lie in the Canterbury Basin, which is a focus for frontier,&lt;br&gt;conventional oil and gas exploration. Extensive surveys were conducted in the Canterbury&lt;br&gt;Basin in the 1970s and 1980s and wells were drilled by BP in 1984. Drilling by another&lt;br&gt;operator is scheduled in an adjacent permit in early 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;A seismic survey is a method of testing the earth’s physical properties using acoustic&lt;br&gt;(sound) waves similar to ultrasound. Data collected is analysed to create an image of the&lt;br&gt;subsurface, which helps to determine whether prospects to drill exist and to resolve the&lt;br&gt;location of any exploration well. The New Zealand Government has a description of the&lt;br&gt;process on the Petroleum and Minerals website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzpam.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/our-industry/factsheets/offshore-seismic-surveying.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The survey was conducted under the New Zealand Department of Conservation 2013 Code&lt;br&gt;of Conduct For Minimising Acoustic Disturbance To Marine Mammals From Seismic Survey&lt;br&gt;Operations. Details of the Code can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/oQLY3v&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://goo.gl/oQLY3v&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas ceo Andrew Knight thanked the local community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Tangata whenua, the Deparment of Conservation and communtiy representatives enabled&lt;br&gt;a successful survey to occur with no impact on the marine environment,” he said.&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 50 per cent interest in Clipper (Petroleum Exploration Permit&lt;br&gt;52717) and is the operator. The remaining 50 per cent is held by ASX-listed Beach Energy.&lt;br&gt;Beach Energy is also a partner with New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas in the Kaheru prospect&lt;br&gt;(PEP52181) offshore South Taranaki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas holds a 100 per cent interest in Galleon (PEP 55792).&lt;br&gt;Attached: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/311213-Clipper-seismic-complete.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release with Map of Clipper and Galleon permits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>New interest acquired in Indonesia</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-interest-acquired-in-indonesia/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has picked up a new interest in a Production Sharing Contract in&lt;br&gt;onshore south Sumatra, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indonesian regulator has announced that a consortium including New Zealand Oil &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;Gas has won a permit to explore the Palmerah Baru block covering approximately 1000 km2.&lt;br&gt;Formal award of the production sharing contract is expected in late January.&lt;br&gt;Under the Production Sharing Contract the joint venture will be committed to an initial threeyear&lt;br&gt;exploration work programme to include both 2D and 3D seismic acquisition and one&lt;br&gt;exploration well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas will have a 36% stake in the Palmerah Baru PSC. Its partners are&lt;br&gt;Bukit Energy Palmerah Baru Pte Ltd (54%, Operator), and PT SNP Indonesia (10%).&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas chief executive Andrew Knight says South Sumatra is a prolific oil&lt;br&gt;province.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Palmerah Baru block is surrounded by oil and gas fields, including a very large field to&lt;br&gt;the south and a recent discovery to the south-southeast. Because of developments in the&lt;br&gt;area, the infrastructure necessary to transport product is nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is targeting opportunities in Indonesia that are in proven onshore&lt;br&gt;basins, close to existing infrastructure, and more likely to be oil than gas.&lt;br&gt;“We have gathered more knowledge about working in Indonesia from our activities in the&lt;br&gt;Kisaran and Bohorok PSCs. These onshore Sumatra opportunities provide diversity to our&lt;br&gt;core focus on exploration in New Zealand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bukit Energy are also partners with New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas in the Kisaran PSC in central&lt;br&gt;Sumatra where two wells were drilled this year (Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas, Operator, 55%; Bukit&lt;br&gt;Energy and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas each 22.5% through subsidiaries); And in the Bohorok&lt;br&gt;PSC in north Sumatra awarded in May 2012 (Bukit Energy, Operator, and New Zealand Oil&lt;br&gt;&amp;amp; Gas each 45%; Surya Buana Lestarijaya, 10%).&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>New permits in 2013 Block Offer</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-permits-in-2013-block-offer/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has acquired interests in three new permits in the New Zealand&lt;br&gt;Government’s 2013 Block Offer; one off Taranaki, one off Canterbury and the third in the&lt;br&gt;Great South Basin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;PEP 55793 ‘Vulcan’ in offshore Taranaki covers 2418 km2. PEP 55794 ‘Toroa’ in the Great&lt;br&gt;South Basin south east of the South Island covers 9835 km2. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, New&lt;br&gt;Zealand’s largest listed explorer, has a 30 per cent interest in each of these permits. New&lt;br&gt;country entrant, Woodside, has a 70 per cent interest and will be operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The new joint ventures are a good mix of our local knowledge and Woodside’s deepwater&lt;br&gt;exploration capability, ” New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas chief executive Andrew Knight said.&lt;br&gt;“New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has been eying substantial targets within the new permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two wells have previously been drilled in PEP 55794 and encountered non-commercial&lt;br&gt;hydrocarbon shows. PEP 55793 is a true frontier permit with substantial unexplored leads.&lt;br&gt;“The involvement of Woodside as operator will deliver operational capability to combine with&lt;br&gt;our understanding of local conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has also been awarded 100% of PEP 55792 ‘Galleon’ off Canterbury. Galleon is immediately south of the Clipper permit, where New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 50 per cent interest. A modest seismic programme is planned in Galleon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Andrew Knight says the new permits increase the company’s exposure to New Zealand’s&lt;br&gt;frontier basins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“They bring higher investment risk with greater prospective resources.”&lt;/p&gt;

Located 12km to the northeast of the Tui Field FPSO, the Oi prospect represents a Prospective Resource of 11 million barrels of recoverable oil (gross, unrisked P50 estimate). In the event of a&lt;br&gt;commercial discovery, existing excess FPSO production capacity at Tui will enable the Oi Field to be tied-in relatively quickly and with low incremental operating costs. The well will be located in approximately 120m of water with the target horizon at 3,200m subsea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/021013-Tui-Mitsui.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas launches its 2014 Portfolio</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-zealand-oil-and-gas-launches-its-2014-portfolio/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;• Offshore New Zealand oil &amp;amp; gas exploration at an all-time high over next 2 years&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas seeking farm in partners for New Zealand 2014 Portfolio&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Multiple drilling targets with potential for hundreds of millions of barrels of oil&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A global marketing campaign is underway to attract exploration partners into four petroleum exploration permits in the offshore Taranaki basin of New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is looking to capitalise on an all time high in New Zealand exploration activity. The Noble Bob Douglas deep-water drill ship, Kan Tan IV semi-submersible rig, and Ensco 107 jack-up rig will drill over a dozen wells in New Zealand in the coming year. They include Matuki-1, Oi-1 and Pateke-4H which are targeting nearly 80 million barrels of oil (gross) for NZ Oil &amp;amp; Gas and its partners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas chief executive Andrew Knight says New Zealand exploration opportunities have never been so high on the agenda for global exploration companies looking for high quality, high-impact opportunities. “Our New Zealand 2014 Portfolio offers new entrants to New Zealand a rapid country entry package.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The permits in the New Zealand 2014 Portfolio contain a balance of scales, water depths and risk/reward levels, and offer a range of timing for potential drilling and for multi-scaled oil or gas developments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is representing the interests of four separate exploration joint ventures and three separate joint venture parties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In all but one, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is the operator. Andrew Knight says that as New Zealand’s largest listed explorer it is recognised as the partner of choice for exploration in New Zealand. “While we can offer operatorship in the permits, partners are also recognising we bring technical capability, relations with New Zealanders in the community and in government, and our New Zealand values in everything we do. We are a nation of explorers.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The marketing campaign for the New Zealand 2014 Portfolio will use a global exploration opportunity marketing service based in London. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outlines of the opportunities in the portfolio are attached below. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suitably qualified, interested companies are invited to express their interest in the opportunities direct to New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interest can be expressed online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/2014offer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nzog.com/2014offer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;At Sunday, 8 September, seven inch casing had been run and cemented at the Parit Minyak-3 (PM-3) well, located in the Kisaran PSC in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The well has been drilled to a depth of 8520 feet (2598 metres).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Open hole logs were run to depth, however subsequent formation pressure data gathering was hindered by degrading hole conditions. Initial log analysis supports deepening the well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Current operation is casing off the open hole section with 7&quot; casing, before drilling to 9000 feet (2744 metres) using a 5 7/8&quot; inch bit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Ltd has a 22.5 per cent stake in the joint venture through its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Parit Minyak-3 (PM-3) located in the Kisaran PSC in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia spudded on 3 August, and as of Sunday, 25 August an 8 ½ inch hole had been drilled to a depth of 8360 feet (2549 metres), following mud gas readings and oil shows in the deepest section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current intention is to drill ahead to a Total Depth of 8500 feet (2591m).The Parit Minyak-2 (PM-2) well fracture stimulation operation was conducted in early August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation has been suspended prior to completion due to high treatment pressures. The operational performance is under evaluation and fracturing operations have been suspended pending the outcome of this review.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Annual Result - Cashflows fund growing exploration portfolio - August 27th </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/cashflows-fund-growing-exploration-portfolio/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Limited today announced a fully imputed final dividend of 3 cents per share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company today released financial results for the year to 30 June 2013.&lt;br&gt;Strong cash flows through the year funded increasing exploration and dividend distributions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exploration and evaluation expenditure for the year was up strongly to NZ$42.2 million, from NZ$9.5 million the previous year, as NZ Oil &amp;amp; Gas looks to replace its producing Taranaki assets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Net profit after tax for the year was NZ$25.9 million, up 30 per cent from NZ$19.9m last year due to abnormal items.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Revenue, EBITDAX and underlying profit fell as the Tui oil field enters its decline phase and because the Kupe gas and oil field was shut down for part of the year for a planned maintenance outage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Revenue for the year was NZ$99.3 million (NZ$116.4m last year). Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and exploration expenses (EBITDAX) were NZ$67.8 million (NZ$70.5m last year).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Normalised after tax profits were NZ$16.7 million, compared to NZ$33.1 million the year before.&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is in a sound financial position, with NZ$158 million in cash on hand at balance date and no debt after the company repaid all NZ$46.6 million of debt in the year (NZ$16.5 million last year).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company says it’s using its cash to fund more exploration and continue to pay a dividend.&lt;br&gt;During the year an interim dividend of 3 cps was paid after the half-year result. The final 3 cps dividend will be paid on 27 September to shareholders on record at 13 September 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;PRODUCING ASSETS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#039;s two producing assets, Kupe and Tui, delivered 1.0 million barrels of oil equivalent. The average price achieved over the year for oil and light oil was US$108.8 per barrel (1.1 mmboe produced in 2012 at an average price of US$114.8 per barrel).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kupe field, in which NZ Oil &amp;amp; Gas holds a 15 per cent interest, produced revenue of NZ$68.8 million for the company, down from NZ$74.3 million the previous year, mainly due to planned maintenance outages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Tui field has entered its natural decline phase and earned NZ Oil &amp;amp; Gas NZ$30.4 million in the full year from its 12.5 per cent share (NZ$42 million in 2012).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company also received a capital return of NZ$5.6 million from Pan Pacific Petroleum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXPLORATION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first overseas well the company has been involved in recently was drilled during the financial year in the Kisaran Production Sharing Contract in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia. While currently drilling is continuing at the Parit Minyak-3 well, oil was recovered to the surface in PM-2 where further testing is underway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preparations have advanced for drilling in offshore Taranaki, at Matuku in September, then at Pateke and Oi (Tui) following Matuku, and at Kaheru in early 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interests in four new exploration permits were acquired offshore from Taranaki: Matuku, Takapou, and Taranga were acquired by farming in, and Waru in the Government&#039;s 2012 New Zealand Block Offer, where the company also picked up an onshore permit, Manaia. In offshore Canterbury New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas farmed into the Clipper permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around a thousand square kilometres of seismic data was acquired: 595 km2 of 3D seismic at Takapou; 298 km2 of 3D seismic at Taranga; and 101 km2 of 3D seismic at Kanuka.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NZ$6.2 million was expensed for the company&#039;s interest in the Kakapo permit (PEP 51311), which was handed back to the Crown in July. In February the company announced its intention to withdraw from its Cosmos concession in Tunisia resulting in NZ$8.8 million being expensed over the year.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Drilling resumes at Kisaran</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/drilling-resumes-at-kisaran/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Drilling is underway at exploration well Parit Minyak-3 (PM-3) located in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia. The well was spudded at 6.00PM Saturday night local time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The PM-3 well targets shallower sandstone reservoirs than those encountered in the Parit Minyak -2 (PM-2) well where drilling commenced in February. It is hoped that the PM-3 well will encounter aerially extensive oil accumulations after the PM-1 and PM-2 wells confirmed an active petroleum system in the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The well is expected to take around 40 days to drill to an expected total depth of 8160 feet (2487 metres).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Ltd has a 22.5 per cent stake in the joint venture through its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd. The Kisaran Joint Venture partners are Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (55 per cent and Operator) and Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Sumatera) Ltd, a subsidiary of Bukit Energy Inc. (22.5 per cent).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hydraulic fracture stimulation operations at the drilled and completed Parit Minyak-2 well are expected to commence this week. Results will be released following execution, analysis and approval by the regulator SKKMigas&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>New Zealand Oil &amp; Gas has relinquished Kakapo </title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/new-zealand-oil-and-gas-has-relinquished-kakapo-/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has relinquished Petroleum Exploration Permit 51311, which contains the Kakapo prospect.&lt;br&gt;NZ Oil &amp;amp; Gas holds a 100 per cent interest in PEP 51311. CEO Andrew Knight says at that level of exposure the permit did not fit the NZ Oil &amp;amp; Gas portfolio at a time when activity is stepping up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;While we are still enthusiastic about Kakapo and would love to drill it, it doesn’t fit our portfolio at 100% exposure when there is so much other activity underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We have made strenuous efforts to find a farmin partner to share the investment risk. While interest in New Zealand’s prospective basins continues to grow, it has not been possible to farm out the prospect and secure a suitable rig contract before a deadline at the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;NZ Oil &amp;amp; Gas is heavily committed to New Zealand and we are excited about the upcoming season when there will be an unprecedented level of drilling activity around New Zealand. For example, we are involved in drilling offshore Taranaki before the end of the year at Matuku and Tui and we are the Operator of Kaheru, where plans to drill in the summer of 2014-15 are advancing.”&lt;br&gt;NZ Oil &amp;amp; Gas will release its quarterly result on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Operator provides Kisaran update</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/operator-provides-kisaran-update/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The operator of the Kisaran Production Sharing Contract in onshore North Sumatera has received approval from the Indonesian regulator to provide the following update:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Kisaran) Ltd, the Operator of Kisaran Production Sharing Contract area, located onshore North Sumatra, said that it has successfully drilled the Parit Minyak-2 (PM-2) exploration well. The well is the second exploration well in the Parit Minyak structure and is located 1.6 km to the north of the Parit Minyak-1 discovery well. The objective of this well was to test upper and middle Pematang Formation reservoirs in order to bring this field into the development phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PM-2 spudded on February 11, 2013 and reached a total depth of 9225 feet MD (9165 feet SS) on April 10, 2013. During drilling several oil shows were noted within Eocene/Oligocene Pematang sandstones within a gross interval of 7500-8900 feet. The base of the oil column was not reached at the cessation of drilling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cased hole drill stem tests (DSTs) were conducted over four intervals, each containing multiple sandstones. From the interval 8136-8330 feet the well flowed 37o API oil at rates in the range of 200-400 BOPD (32/64” choke, 80-100 psi flowing well head pressure) with no water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A hydraulic fracture program has been prepared to stimulate one of the DST intervals in order to test increasing the productivity of the reservoir. This programme is scheduled for late August 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The drilling rig will now be moved to the site of the next Kisaran exploration well, Parit Minyak-3, which is estimated to spud mid-July 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Ltd has a 22.5% stake in the joint venture through the share ownership of its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd in Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (North Sumatera) Ltd. The Kisaran Joint Venture partners are Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Kisaran) Ltd (55 per cent and operator) and Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Sumatera) Inc (22.5 per cent).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/12072013-Operator-provides-Kisaran-update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kisaran rig moves to new well site</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/kisaran-rig-moves-to-new-well-site/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The rig used to drill the Parit Minyak-2 (PM-2) exploration well, located in the Kisaran PSC in onshore Sumatra, is being moved to the Parit Minyak-3 (PM-3) drill site. Drilling at PM-3 is expected to begin before the end of July.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, fracture stimulation of the Pemantang 4 formation in the PM-2 well is scheduled for late August/September 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has become aware that certain media reports have been published claiming the well at PM-2 has been plugged and abandoned after testing maximum production rates of 100 barrels per day. These reports are incorrect. In fact the well is suspended while preparations for fracture stimulation continue. The operator is not yet in a position to announce potential flow rates or forecast the commercial viability of the well. A report detailing actual production rates will be released to the market following approval by Indonesian authorities. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is encouraged by results from drill stem tests to date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a waiver from the NZX in relation to certain disclosures about progress in testing because announcements can only be made with approval from the Indonesian regulator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Ltd has a 22.5% stake in the joint venture through the share ownership of its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd in Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (North Sumatera) Ltd. The Kisaran Joint Venture partners are Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Kisaran) Ltd (55 per cent and operator) and Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Sumatera) Inc (22.5 per cent).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/02072013-Kisaran-update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Flow testing is continuing at the Parit Minyak-2 (PM-2) exploration well, located in the Kisaran PSC in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flow testing in the well began on 29 April. Three drill stem tests (DSTs) have been conducted to date with a fourth underway. Test results have been encouraging to date. Stimulation of one of the tested intervals is being planned for sometime in the next month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rig onsite is expected to be relocated to a second drill site at Parit Minyak-3 before the end of June.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a waiver from the NZX in relation to certain disclosures about progress in testing because announcements can only be made with approval from the Indonesian regulator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A further announcement is anticipated when testing is complete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Ltd has a 22.5% stake in the joint venture through the share ownership of its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd in Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (North Sumatera) Ltd.&lt;br&gt;The Kisaran Joint Venture partners are Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Kisaran) Ltd (55 per cent and operator) and Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Sumatera) Inc (22.5 per cent).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/04062013-Kisaran-flow-testing-continues.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kan Tan IV expected to drill Matuku in September</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/kan-tan-iv-expected-to-drill-matuku-in-september/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A likely start date has been confirmed for drilling in the Matuku prospect in PEP 51906 off Taranaki where New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas holds a 12.5 per cent interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The permit&#039;s operator, OMV, has advised that the semi-submersible rig Kan Tan IV is expected to begin drilling in mid-September. The well is expected to take 40 days to drill to a target depth of 4756 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator has publicly estimated mean recoverable resource for the prospect at around 65 million barrels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participants in PEP 51906 are: OMV New Zealand (Operator) 65 per cent; Octanex 22.5 per cent; and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas 12.5 per cent. If Matuku-1 is successful, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has an option to acquire a further 5 per cent of Octanex&#039;s share, which would equalise each company&#039;s interest at 17.5 per cent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/Kan-Tan-IV-expected-to-drill-Matuku.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>NZ Oil &amp; Gas returns to Canterbury Basin</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/nz-oil-and-gas-returns-to-canterbury-basin/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has acquired a 50 per cent interest in PEP 52717 (Clipper) from Beach Petroleum (NZ) Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of ASX-listed Beach Energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas will become the operator of the permit, which is off the Canterbury coast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The partners have committed to acquiring at least 600 square kilometres of 3D seismic by October next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new permit restores exposure to the prospectivity of the Canterbury Basin with an established partner on ground floor terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deal is subject to regulatory approval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beach was recently granted an extension to PEP 52717 that largely incorporates the Barque structure and a related lead. It is mapped to extend across the previous southern boundary of the permit. An area of low prospectivity in the northwest of the original PEP 52717 was surrendered so as to approximately maintain the overall area of the permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extensive 2D seismic surveys were conducted in the Canterbury Basin in the 1970s and 1980s before the only existing well in the block, Clipper-1, was drilled by BP in 1984, recovering samples of hydrocarbon gas during wireline logging from a depth of over 4000m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today the Canterbury and Great South Basin system is the major focus for frontier conventional oil and gas exploration in New Zealand, with drilling in an adjacent permit scheduled for early next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beach Energy is also a partner with New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas in the Kaheru prospect (PEP52181), offshore South Taranaki.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Attachment: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/150513-Clipper-acquisition.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;News Release &amp;amp; Map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Karoro 3D Seismic Survey Completed</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/karoro-3d-seismic-survey-completed/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The partners in the permit, Octanex and New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, were required to acquire 225 square kilometres of 3D seismic data in the 3500 square kilometre permit. The Karoro survey easily passed the requirement, acquiring 290 square kilometres of data, of which 269 square kilometres was within the permit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WesternGeco&#039;s vessel Western Monarch began the survey on the night of 21/22 April, immediately following the successful completion of a larger survey in the Takapou permit (PEP 53473) immediately to the south of Taranga. Both permits lie north of the producing Tui oil field in the offshore Taranaki basin. (See map &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/Karoro-3D-Seismic-Survey-Completed.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NZOG adopted a Code of Conduct developed by the Department of Conservation for minimising acoustic disturbance to marine mammals. Passive acoustic monitoring equipment was used and four specialist observers aboard kept watch to ensure marine mammals weren’t adversely affected during the survey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is the operator and holds a 50 per cent interest in the permit, with the remaining 50 per cent held by Octanex NZ Limited, a subsidiary of ASX-listed explorer Octanex NL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Flow testing has begun at the Parit Minyak-2 (PM-2) exploration well, located in&lt;br&gt;the Kisaran PSC in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An announcement was made previously that a decision had been taken to conduct up to four drill stem tests (DSTs) within a gross interval of 7700 to 9000 feet, based on wireline logging results.&lt;br&gt;Depending on the types of fluids and rates of flow this testing program could&lt;br&gt;take 20 to 35 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further announcement about progress in testing will be made when approved&lt;br&gt;by the Indonesian regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Ltd has a 22.5% stake in the joint venture through the&lt;br&gt;share ownership of its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd in Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (North&lt;br&gt;Sumatera) Ltd.

			<title>Address by Andrew Knight at the 2013 Petroleum Conference</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/address-by-andrew-knight-at-the-2013-petroleum-conference/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the great Maori traditions is to begin a business meeting with a story about who you are and where you come from. Only when people know each other’s values do we move to specifics. Since our industry places enduring partnerships at the centre of our activity, we can usefully adapt this tradition. Putting relationships and values first is part of what it means to do things in a distinctively New Zealand way. So our story begins in an ancient Maori legend about a great chief from a Polynesian Island, countless generations ago. His name was Kupe. The story begins, as so many perfect days do, with Kupe out on his boat fishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this day was different: He was catching nothing. When he pulled up his lines, all his bait had been taken. Next day, same thing: his lines would go in, no catch. Eventually he discovered a great octopus was taking his bait and eating his catch. So Kupe decided to catch it, and a great pursuit commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He provisioned his boat and set out for the horizon. Eventually the chase led him to New Zealand, where the prized octopus was caught. Kupe spent a long time exploring the new land he had found, then eventually returned home to bring others back. He told them of its rivers and of travelling from harbour to harbour, of greenstone pounamu in the South Island, and richness on the land. He told of planting a tree at the mouth of a river opening to the southwest wind, beneath a snow clad mountain standing near the sea. &quot;Direct your canoe there and you will see the best place to settle,&quot; Kupe told them. And so the very first New Zealanders were explorers, who travelled here in pursuit of a prize beneath the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kupe&#039;s legend is a story of New Zealand&#039;s strengths and our place in the international context. From Kupe, to Captain Cook, to the sealers and settlers, to the newest arrival - every family in these islands has a story of travel, a story of starting over, a story of exploration. People who aren&#039;t from, or haven’t visited New Zealand often don&#039;t realise that everything here arrived either by swimming, flying or drifting further than anyone else. That&#039;s why New Zealanders bred explorers who were first to the ceiling of the world, who travel the oceans in racing yachts, and pioneer extreme sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a thousand years after Kupe was in Taranaki - maybe a little more, or a little less - a gunsmith called Edward Smith found oil on a New Plymouth beach. His discovery inspired a new generation of explorers. And one day, many years and discoveries later, in Taranaki&#039;s southwest, in full view of the mountain standing near the sea, they found a gas and oil field they called Kupe. Today, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is proud to earn the substantial share of our income from the Kupe field. We are literally explorers to our core. And just as then, we recognise that Taranaki is a starting place, but there is abundance beyond. New Zealand is geologically complex, and full of promise. Yet for all its prospective resources, New Zealand is also relatively underexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciting new discoveries are waiting in new basins. We are excited by what we have seen off the Canterbury coast. We know there are resources in the Great South basin and in deepwater around New Zealand that is almost totally un-searched. Others at this conference will talk about the prospectivity of those basins. What I want to focus on is what it will take in a business sense to unlock them. There is a technical challenge, but it’s more than that. It&#039;s also an economic issue in a context where there are other basins in the world. And there is a social and regulatory context capable of valuing success in the oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to discuss both the social, and the economic context. Since it was established in 1981, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has had enough economic success over the years to graduate from junior status to become a producer. What we have learned over the years is that exploring in New Zealand brings its own challenges to a global business. New Zealand requires a co-operative industry to share the investment risk, and we have a smaller industry than most countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand has a higher drilling cost structure because of the cost of mobilising, and a less frequent drilling programme. This context, in turn, requires strong partnerships, and long-term perspectives – the need for a long term perspective and strong partnerships applies to us, our partners, the government and the communities in which we operate. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas diversified overseas to provide balance in our investment portfolio. We’re still proving to ourselves whether we can do it successfully. No other oil and gas company from New Zealand has yet met this challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to make it work, we need to bring our New Zealand way of doing things – our values and our culture. Bringing this perspective to what we do is what gets me up in the morning, and makes me passionate about what we do. The opportunity to make a contribution to New Zealand is not an abstract concept; it means a real difference for jobs, and opportunities. I want kids growing up in Taranaki to understand there are opportunities for them beneath the surface in their region, and for those kids to study the science and management skills needed to lead my company in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we can&#039;t take for granted that everyone sees our industry as making a contribution. It&#039;s easy for us to say we deserve community support for the opportunities we create. It&#039;s harder for us, but crucial, to understand that we need to earn community support. The same features of New Zealand&#039;s geographical isolation that created our underground resources also created a stunningly beautiful environment. New Zealanders are incredibly proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a deep emotional commitment to the way of life we associate with our waters, mountains, land and rivers. And so, while New Zealanders recognise our forty years of safe operating in New Zealand, we also know the consequence of failure could be desperately high. Our communities fear that they, not us, will bear the consequences, if we fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why they seek to ask us searching questions. It&#039;s entirely understandable that they do, and our social licence to operate has to be earned - repeatedly and continuously - by being able to answer their questions satisfactorily. That’s part of forming the long-term community partnerships we need. I started out by talking about an emerging New Zealand habit of talking about our values when we sit down to talk business. New Zealanders expect be ethical, to show concern for our neighbours. We expect fairness in dealing, not selfish advantage. We have a love of our unique physical environment cradled in our understanding that it is remote, and it is our home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have a tradition of having to be resourceful. We have learned or inherited a sense of adventure and the freedom that a small country has to innovate and be creative. As this conference begins we have seen some public questioning of our industry. I have also noticed the consistent theme – we’re being asked to show the benefit to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I do this, and why I&#039;m proud to lead a New Zealand oil and gas company is that we do make a difference. The Tui field, in which New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has an interest, is a small field by international standards. But over its lifetime it will contribute around $2 billion in royalties and taxes for the government of New Zealand. That pays for a lot of schools and hospitals. Our international partners make a vital contribution too. They bring capital, expertise and technology that we do not have without them. We could not unlock our resources alone without our partners. So New Zealanders have a choice between New Zealanders discovering New Zealand’s resources for the benefit of New Zealanders – or New Zealanders going offshore to unlock someone else’s resources for their benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s New Zealand’s international context, and it’s why I warmly welcome our potential partners entering New Zealand. Our community wants to see the highest standards of environmental performance, and health and safety processes. So do I – one of the features of New Zealand that helps to set us apart, and helps me to attract staff to come to New Zealand, is the lifestyle and quality of life. There is a role for government in establishing that it is not seeking a choice between environment and development. There is a role also in championing the opportunities and wealth that those resources can create for New Zealanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there’s a role in making sure the industry can flex our enterprise and initiative. That’s why I stress that it’s important to get the balance right in the allocation of new permits. We need to both encourage new overseas market entrants, and allow participation by smaller players who bring in larger partners. New Zealand has a lot of competition for explorers’ attention, and having more advocates marketing us internationally will help. This is a balance that New Zealand needs to get right in assessing bids in the Block Offer round. What all this amounts to is an international context in which New Zealand provides an unusual set of opportunities. Our isolation has created a unique geological context, and a heritage of values that understand and support exploration. But isolation also means our star shines more faintly in the global search for resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have to be unusually careful to earn – and keep earning - trust in our activity, and we must be creative in attracting partners. For New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas, the New Zealand story is our story: A story of potential that can be unleashed by strong and enduring partnerships. And so I take pleasure in welcoming partners to the New Zealand oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Drilling underway at Kisaran</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/drilling-underway-at-kisaran/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Drilling is underway at exploration well Parit Minyak-2 (PM-2) located in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Ltd has a 22.5 per cent stake in the joint venture through its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd. The well in the Kisaran Production Sharing Contract is the first New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has been involved with outside New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kisaran Joint Venture partners are Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (55 per cent and operator) and Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (Sumatera) Ltd, a subsidiary of Bukit Energy Inc. (22.5 per cent).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The well was spudded at 10.30PM last night local time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The well is expected to take around 45 days to drill. It will appraise an undeveloped oil discovery made in 2006, and explore additional zones that were not present in that well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second well, PM-3, also in the Kisaran block, is planned immediately following operations at PM-2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/20130212-Kisaran-spuds.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Drilling begins at Kisaran (includes map)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Raisama withdraws from Kakapo Farm-in</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/raisama-withdraws-from-kakapo-farm-in/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has been advised that Raisama Energy Limited is withdrawing from its farm-in arrangement to participate in drilling the Kakapo structure in PEP 51311, offshore Taranaki Basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raisama had acquired the opportunity to earn a 10 per cent interest in the prospect by paying 20 per cent of drilling costs up to $3 million and 10 per cent after that. As the well has not yet been drilled, Raisama&#039;s withdrawal means it won&#039;t incur these costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chief executive Andrew Knight says New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas continues to seek further farm-in partners and a drilling rig on suitable terms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas believes the Kakapo prospect looks attractive as part of a portfolio of opportunities,&quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/20130212-Raisama.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Raisama withdraws from Kakapo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Ministerial consent has been received for three sale and farmin agreements between New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas and ASX-listed Octanex NL over petroleum exploration permits 51906, 53473 and 52593.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In November last year New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas announced it would pay US$12.5 million for a 12.5 per cent interest in Petroleum Exploration Permit 51906 (Matuku), where the semi-submersible rig Kan Tan IV is to drill in the coming 2013-24 season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other permits in the agreement receiving ministerial consent are PEP 53473 and PEP 52593 where New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas will acquire 50 per cent interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In PEP 53473, a survey will obtain seismic 3D data across 600 square kilometres within the permit this year. The permit requires data to be acquired and processed across 250 square kilometres by March next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/18022013-matuku-consent-seismic.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Consent received - with permit maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Seismic survey update 22nd April</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/seismic-survey-updatenew-blog-entry/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Both permits lie north of the producing Tui oil field in the offshore Taranaki basin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The survey in the Takapou permit (PEP 53473) covered almost 600 square kilometres and began on 4 April. It was expected to take up to 20 days. With generally fine weather and few marine mammal encounters the survey has been completed ahead of schedule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At around 3 o&#039;clock this morning WesternGeco&#039;s seismic survey vessel Western Monarch moved on to begin a 3D survey covering around 300 square kilometres in the Taranga permit, PEP52593. It&#039;s expected to be completed in the first week of May, subject to weather and other possible interruptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NZOG has adopted a Code of Conduct developed by the Department of Conservation for minimising acoustic disturbance to marine mammals. As in the earlier survey, passive acoustic monitoring equipment will be used and four specialist observers aboard will keep a round the clock watch to ensure marine mammals aren&#039;t adversely affected during the survey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In both permits New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas is the operator and holds a 50 per cent interest, with the remaining 50 per cent held by Octanex NZ Limited, a subsidiary of ASX-listed explorer Octanex NL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Pagani&lt;br&gt;External Relations Manager&lt;br&gt;M: +64 21 570 872&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/22nd-April-Seismic-Survey-Update-With-Map.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Seismic survey update (includes map)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Kisaran Exploration Well weekly progress report 15th April</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/kisaran-exploration-well-weekly-progress-report-15th-april/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Target depth has been reached and the well is being readied for further assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A target depth of 9225 feet (2812m) has been reached in the exploration well Parit Minyak-2 (PM-2), located in the Kisaran PSC in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia, and the well is being readied for further assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial evaluation by wireline logging in the open hole section began 10 April, and is due to be completed this week. If the results are positive, the well will be reinforced with steel casing and cement (a 4-5 day process) and flow testing will be undertaken. An announcement will be made if flow testing is pursued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the nature of the tests and the performance of the well, this testing could take 10-20 days. It is only after the testing results are known that the commercial viability of the well can be estimated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas Ltd has a 22.5% stake in the joint venture through the share ownership of its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd in Pacific Oil &amp;amp; Gas (North Sumatera) Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Half Year Results to 31 December 2013</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/half-year-results-to-31-december-2013/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;With its producing assets continuing to perform as expected, the company today announced net profit after tax of $7.7 million for the six months to 31 December 2012, up from $1.7 million in the corresponding previous six month period. [All figures in NZD].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A trading halt was requested on Thursday because NZOG recognised that decisions relating to expensing its Cosmos assets produced a result materially different to expectations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company&#039;s two producing assets, Kupe and Tui, contributed net operating cashflows of $25.2 million for the six months, compared to net operating cashflows of $26.5 million in the prior year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The $6.0 million increase in net profit after tax is largely a result of changes in two net finance cost items: The prior period included impairment losses relating to Pike River Coal Limited, while the strengthening New Zealand dollar resulted in a fall in the value of USD holdings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company has also fully expensed its investment in the Cosmos South development plan in Tunisia. NZOG&#039;s assessment of the current development plan for the project does not meet the company&#039;s investment criteria and on that basis NZOG would not proceed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exploration (EBITDAX) were $27.9 million ($33.0 million in the comparable six months to December 2011.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas ended the period with a net cash position at 31 December of $171.0 million.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The half-year result was achieved despite a scheduled maintenance shutdown at the Kupe production facility in October, which reduced revenue for the period to $47.9 million ($54.6 million in the six months to 31 December 2011.) Revenue reductions were largely offset by savings in amortisation, which is based on the Kupe field&#039;s production profile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company has decided to move to paying its dividend in interim and final stages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shareholders at 15 March 2013 will receive a fully imputed interim dividend of 3 cents per share, which will be paid on 5 April 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shareholders can reinvest dividends free of brokerage charges through the company&#039;s dividend reinvestment programme, but a discount previously offered through the plan will no longer be applied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Operating Performance&lt;br&gt;New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 15 per cent interest in the Kupe gas and oil field. Kupe contributed $31.2 million in revenue in the six month period. The company&#039;s share of Kupe production for the period was 1.3 PJ of sales gas; 5,323 tonnes of LPG; and 112,976 barrels of light oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Tui area oil fields contributed revenue of $16.6 million in the six month period for the 12.5 per cent stake held by New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas. The company&#039;s share of Tui production for the period was just over 114,000 barrels of oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Portfolio development&lt;br&gt;During the half year, New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas significantly stepped up activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It acquired interests in four new offshore Taranaki permits - one through the Government&#039;s 2012 Block Offer, and three in a deal with Octanex NL. Exploration drilling in one of those, the Matuku prospect offshore from Taranaki, will begin in the coming drill season. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas also acquired an onshore Taranaki prospect in the Block Offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In October New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas farmed out the Kaheru permit it operates, where drilling will also begin in the coming 2013-14 drill season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drilling has begun in the Kisaran Production Sharing Contract in onshore Sumatra, Indonesia, where NZOG has a 22.5% interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/01032013-Interim-result-HY13.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Half Year results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/NZOG-Interim-Financial-Statements-31-12-12.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Financial Statements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/Appendix-7-NZOG-Interim-Dividend-1-3-13.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dividend Details&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Two new wells to be drilled in Oi &amp; Pateke</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/two-new-wells-to-be-drilled-in-oi-and-pateke/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke 4H infill development well; and&lt;br&gt;Oi exploration well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The operator of the permit, AWE, has negotiated an agreement to use the semi-submersible rig Kan Tan IV to drill the wells in the second half of 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NZOG chief executive Andrew Knight says the company is stepping up exploration activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;These prospects are promising and NZOG is excited about our increased exploration activity. In addition to the new exploration in the Tui permit Pateke and Oi prospects, drilling is also planned in the coming season in the Matuku, Kaheru and Kakapo prospects off Taranaki. NZOG is also diversifying overseas with drilling due to begin in Sumatra.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NZOG will participate in the new wells at its existing equity level of 12.5 per cent and AWE will remain the Operator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pateke-4H targets a newly mapped northern extension of the field (Pateke North) that is not being accessed by the current producing well, Pateke-3H.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PMP 38158 (Tui - Pateke prospect)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;NZOG 12.5%&lt;br&gt;AWE 42.5% (Operator)&lt;br&gt;Mitsui 35%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum 10%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Oi exploration well is 13 kilometres northeast of the Tui field in approximately 120 metres of water. Pan Pacific Petroleum, in which NZOG holds a 15 per cent equity stake, will increase its participation in the Oi well to 50 per cent under the sole risk provisions of the Tui Joint Operating Agreement. AWE and Mitsui have elected to participate in the Oi exploration well at reduced equities; They have the option to restore their full equities in any development through buy back of equity from Pan Pacific Petroleum which will comprise reimbursement of pro-rata costs together with the payment of a buy back premium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PMP 38158 (Tui - Oi prospect)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;NZOG 12.5%&lt;br&gt;AWE 25% (Operator)&lt;br&gt;Mitsui 12.5%&lt;br&gt;Pan Pacific Petroleum 50%&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/29012013-Pateke-Oi.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Download news release &quot;Two new wells to be drilled in Pateke &amp;amp; Oi&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Update on Sumatra exploration</title>
			<link>https://www.nzog.com/news/update-on-sumatra-exploration/</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The operator of an exploration block in Central Sumatra Basin, Indonesia, has advised that drilling of one exploratory well, Parit Minyak-2, is expected to begin around 27 January. New Zealand Oil &amp;amp; Gas has a 22.5 per cent stake in the block through its subsidiary NZOG Asia Pty Ltd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parit Minyak-2 is the first well NZOG has been involved in drilling outside New Zealand as the company diversifies internationally while retaining a core focus on New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Major site construction work at PM-2 was finished on 23 December. Drilling was scheduled to commence before the end of 2012 but equipment mobilisation has been hampered by wet weather and other logistical factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kisaran block is located in the Barumun trough in the northern part of the Central Sumatra Basin - the most prolific oil producing basin in South East Asia. The Parit Minyak-2 well will appraise an undeveloped oil discovery made in 2006, and explore additional zones that were not present in that well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second well, Parit Minyak-3, is scheduled to follow with construction of the access road currently underway. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nzog.com/assets/News-Documents/20130114-Kisaran-Progress-Update.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Update on Sumatra exploration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
